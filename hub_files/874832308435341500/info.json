The character featured here is Johnny Silverhand. Keannu Reeves voice acted and mo-capped him. He wakes up the protagonist in a promo video and says \"Wake up Samurai, we have a city to burn.\" So this is based on that phrase and mood. He's just a really interesting character that I can't wait to learn more about.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/874832308435341500"}
