I am basing myself on the “Lean UX” methodology and more precisely on Phase 4, ie “Prototype and Modeling” to use this Kit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To answer the problem, it is often difficult to create / transcribe its zoning in a nice zoning that allows the parties to easily plan the future interface. And in some cases, if the client / company is unable to project enough, they will need graphic models. And we all know that's not the best (and fair) solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>🧠 With this zoning kit, there is no need to take the lead in creating beautiful zonings, beautiful compositions. I already did it for you! You start with a solid foundation and you can grow from that file by customizing the colors if you want.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you enjoy it, stay tuned for various upcoming developments and feel free to follow me for other publications 😉</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>🧰 How to use:</strong></h2><p>Duplicate the file and you can start using the components / templates provided for this purpose directly in your project!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This Figma file includes the pages:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>🔒 Cover</p><p>📕 Guidelines : Use of Zoning</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>👩‍🚀 Zoning Kit Components</p><p>📱💻 Templates screens</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>🤗 Share and follow :&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Share this kit with your friends, colleagues and even your business!</p><p>Also, I'm interested to know how you design your Zoning and if I may have forgotten any components in the Kit.
