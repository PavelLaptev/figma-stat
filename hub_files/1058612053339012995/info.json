I wanted to create an app that best fits some of the in-game features. For those who don't know much about the game, when you start the game you will owe Tom Nook $50,000 (Bells) and eventually more and you have to pay him back while doing labor around the island. I thought a banking app would be the most appropriate design feature to create. </p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1058612053339012995"}
