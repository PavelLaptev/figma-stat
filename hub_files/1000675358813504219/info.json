This week I try to generate color spectrum or color in color wheel in needs for projects related to making graphics, web, apps, or print.</p><p><br></p><p>My approach is try to generate colors that beautiful and accessible. Accessible mean the colors should be meeting accessibility criteria such as minimum contrast ratio defined by <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WCAG</a>. So, I decided to use <a href=\"https://leonardocolor.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Leonardo</a>, because this tools generated color based on desired on contrast ratio.</p><p><br></p><p>As the function of the color spectrum is just to act as \"color library\", every color I generate not yet mapped to the function of each color. So, the next step is to map colors to be more semantic and functional. For example: When we need color for text or background of button, designers will know what color they will choose.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1000675358813504219"}
