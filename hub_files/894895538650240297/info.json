This maybe <strong>makes sense</strong> but there are <strong>certain cases</strong> where the designer needs both modes on - especially when horizontal stretching is desired.</p><p><br></p><p>This method is based on the VAL and imitates the HAL. <strong>It is not 100% suitable for multi-column layouts</strong> but <strong>solves every-day issues</strong> that arise when building micro-layouts such as list items, cards, teasers etc.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/894895538650240297"}
