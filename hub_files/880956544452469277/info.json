I realized there wasn't any Tumblr UI or Icons file published on the Figma Community so, I did one I'll be trying to keep it up to date. I hope it can be useful or just for having fun.&nbsp;So, this first version is containing the next things:\n\n‚Ä¢ Icons (navbar and post)\n‚Ä¢ Components (Personal post and a user post)\n‚Ä¢ Navbar\n‚Ä¢ Top bar\n\nI'll be trying to keep it up to date, hope it's practical for everyone.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/880956544452469277"}
