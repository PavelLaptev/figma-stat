I found that deciding on only 6 things to track and only representing those things with a simple dot makes this an easy but also quite meaningful exercise to keep up with. I've enjoyed reflecting on the year through my dots, so maybe you might find some value in it too.</p><p><br></p><h2>Getting started:</h2><ol><li>Label your 6 categories. Some examples could be smoking, running, cooking, going to the gym, sex, alcohol, catching up with friends, buying something, being sick. I'd encourage you to track 3 positive things that you want to do often, and 3 negative things that you want to do less.</li><li>Change up the colors! These are just 6 different enough colors that I found useful to use, but the dots are components that you can change the colors on, which will reflect across your whole calendar.</li><li>Drag dots from the Sticker Sheet over to the calendar whenever you want to track something. Aesthetically, I like to just drop them on the day and not worry about alignment. Feels more natural.</li></ol>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/918114022155561352"}
