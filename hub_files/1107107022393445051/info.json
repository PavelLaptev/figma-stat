The goal is to feature all of the products the locations offer in one place, as well as provide the consumers about information about the origin of the products. The website also offers a \"Recipes\" section where users are able to select which products they have at home and be provided with recipes they can make.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1107107022393445051"}
