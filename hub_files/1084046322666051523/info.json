By starting the phrases with “How might we“, it is implied that there is a solution to the problem but not what the solution actually is.</p><p><br></p><h2>Summary</h2><p>After gathering all insights from your research, including (but not limited to) personas, scribbles, notes, quotes etc., the How Might We method is used to create a starting point for further development and communication of these insights. The goal is to sum up the insights in short and concise sentences and to ask yourself what the problems are that you want to solve, starting with “How might we”. By doing so, you will create an optimistic and constructive starting point and also a great foundation for onboarding new project members.</p><p><br></p><h2>Step-by-step</h2><ol><li>Review the insights and boil them down to their core, ending up with single statements that we can work with in the next step.</li><li>Iteratively, create multiple “How might we…” questions for each insight statement. The questions should neither be phrased too sharply nor too widely. Add considerations to the worksheet if there are any.</li></ol>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1084046322666051523"}
