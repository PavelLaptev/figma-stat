See it like a starter kit builder, where we put the emphasis on making that customization process easy and playful.</p><p>It’s not as extensive as a UI Kit, but the focus for us was to make it light with essentials components and a neutral style, so it doesn’t bias the UI design process.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>*** WHO SHOULD USE IT &amp; WHY? ***</strong></p><p>Designers from all levels, who work on multiples projects and want to focus on actual UX/UI design, rather than setting up Figma.</p><p>As a bureau of design and technology, we launch new projects very often and it was a pain for our designer to setup their foundations and components almost from scratch every time. Since each designer had their own habits, deliverables files were not always standard for our front-end developers.</p><p>The Source Design Framework is an attempt to fix these pain points. It was also important for us to pass on knowledge and best practices for junior profiles and students, that’s why we put lots of efforts writing tutorials &amp; documentation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>*** ABOUT SOURCE ***</strong></p><p>Source is a group of designers &amp; technologists on a mission to make Corporate and Startups more capable through state of the art digital solutions.</p><p>Visit our website for more info and job opportunities:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://source.paris/en/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">https://source.paris/en/</a></p><p><br></p><p>If you find this design framework useful, share it!</p><p>Follow us on Twitter for updates:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/source_paris\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/source_paris</a></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1106260105330103159"}
