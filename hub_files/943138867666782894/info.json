Incorporated into our regular meetings, every one drags their avatars into the center piece according to how they feel that day/week/Sprint, with 1 being the worst and 10 being the best. The facilitation after the drag-and-drop can be an open forum, or one-by-one sharing by each member. Feel free to adopt it to your needs!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/943138867666782894"}
