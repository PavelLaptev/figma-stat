It utilizes auto layout and is a fun, quick (and clunky) way of chatting with your colleagues directly inside your Figma files.\n\nSo the big question is: Why use this when there is a Figma chat plugin I can use? (search for Figma Chat, ya'll)\n\nWell, I’ve found that discussing things in Figma with my co-workers using this chat is good for a few reasons:\n\n1. It’s right where the design lives. Being able to have a quick chat where your design is very useful. We used to just create regular text areas and use them to chat, this is just a more fancy looking version :)\n\n2. I can run another plugin at the same time as I use this chat. That’s not possible with the Figma Chat plugin.\n\n3. Being able to move messages up and down in your conversation is surprisingly handy. \n\n4. It’s really fun, and weird, and clunky. But I love it :)\n \n5. I wanted to see how I could use Auto Layout in a cool new way.\n\n6. Best part of it: when the chat is over, you can just delete it. No chat history, nothing. Just like a water cooler discussion IRL. \n\nHope you find this as useful as I have. Please contact me if you have any questions or just want to say hi :) You can reach me on Twitter @baobame","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/837938435694117093"}
