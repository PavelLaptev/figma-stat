Instead of defining an array of shades up front, it provides a way to do it as you go - in a sustainable, systematic manner and without making a mess.</p><p><br></p><p>This method also suggests how to define colors in dev.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>It's a method! Once you learn it, it's easy to apply and keep colors nice and tidy. And methods are especially useful for teams so that everyone's on the same page.</li><li>It's flexible! There's probably not going to be a situation where you can't create a light-enough or dark-enough variation.</li><li>For devs, if a base color changes, you only need to change one variable to update everything.</li><li>Any new color remains harmonious with the base color scheme</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>For designers, if a base color changes, you may need to do quite a bit of updates (since base color is detached in color mixes). Maybe there's a plugin to quickly do it...</li><li>Naming isn't exactly meaningful.</li><li>Naming may not make sense if a color gets too light or too dark.</li></ul>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1080235825924779666"}
