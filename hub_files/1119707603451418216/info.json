Complete prototyping is done by me. This was a big design contrast to all other things I have worked on and this time I learned the need to group. I have created the Design for the iPad at the moment but soon it will be updated with the iPhone design as well so make sure you follow me on the community page to get all the updates. </p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1119707603451418216"}
