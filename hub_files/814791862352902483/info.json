Much like Myspace, each profile is visually designed like an online profileâ€”folks have the flexibility to create, arrange, and personalize however many windows they want to introduce themselves. \n\nWe will soon have the profiles up on our website (http://tinyfactories.space), and one day, we will have them on a physical wall as well.\n\nIf you'd like to introduce your own community to Figma, we've made the file publicly available, so you can play around with it! :-)","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/814791862352902483"}
