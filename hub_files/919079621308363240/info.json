In this activity, participants individually come up with prioritizations and issues they'd like to solve (in the form of questions) before the group votes on importance and places them on the matrix. This activity is fantastic for setting OKRs and prioritizing goals.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/919079621308363240"}
