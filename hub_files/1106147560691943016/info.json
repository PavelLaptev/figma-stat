Group discussions usually are moderated conversations about multiple topics, through which the moderator guides the group along. It is important to provide everyone with the same talking time share and to be de-escalating at all times in order to ensure best possible conditions for a constructive atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Step-by-step</strong></h2><ol><li>Prepare the topics you want to discuss and put them into a flow.</li><li>Prepare for possible directions in which the discussion might turn.
