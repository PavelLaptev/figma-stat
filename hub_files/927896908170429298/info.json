Typography, colors and styles are the palette building blocks. They are controlled by the OpenBridge palettes; bright, day, dusk and night.</p><p>The OpenBridge palettes; bright, day, dusk and night are made up of three parallel concepts: typography, colors and styles. This breaks with the common practice in maritime UX design where a palette are describing colors alone. OpenBridge approach to palettes allow us to alter style and font in addition to color in order to make sure a palette has optimal contrast and readability.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Day</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/927896761794632560/Palette-Day\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.figma.com/community/file/927896761794632560/Palette-Day</a></p><p><strong>Dusk</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/927896908170429298/Palette-Dusk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.figma.com/community/file/927896908170429298/Palette-Dusk</a></p><p><strong>Night </strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/927896830689433457/Palette-Night\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.figma.com/community/file/927896830689433457/Palette-Night</a></p><p><br></p><p>You can alter the OpenBridge palettes in your design by using the “Themer” plugin in Figma.
