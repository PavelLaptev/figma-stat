That's the reason why this toolkit was created, to enable people to design their own bots, virtual agents, digital assistants etcetera.</p><p><br></p><p>The toolkit consists of multiple canvases and decks of cards covering different CUX topics. It should serve as a guide and is mainly there to spark discussion between business stakeholders, designers and developers. Therefore, the decisions made when using this toolkit, do not need to be final. It is recommended to use the toolkit as a group exercise, for example when facilitating a design workshop. However, it can also be used as an individual exercise.</p><p><br></p><p>Please note that this is a subset of the toolkit and that the complete toolkit (more canvases and more cards) can be provided as a service by the UX Services team within&nbsp;Microsoft.</p><p><br></p><p>Again, many thanks to all people within Microsoft who have supported in developing this toolkit.&nbsp;</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1044999262220337719"}
