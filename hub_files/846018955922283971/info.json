Way too many onboarding flows are flawed and missing many details in the process, so hopefully this file will help you to fill in at least some of the missing pieces and make the implementation easier + increase the experience for the user. \n\nIf you decide to use the file somehow, it would be nice, but not necessary, to get a ping on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mikamatikainen. Happy to see how the file will be used. :-)\n\nViews included:\n* Background info\n* Splash screen\n* Info about the service including sign up CTA's\n* SMS verification with all states\n* Asking permission for Bluetooth access\n* Asking permission for Location access\n* Loading and success views\n* Transition indicator views\n* Main view of the service\n* Asking permission for Notifications\n\nEnjoy!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/846018955922283971"}
