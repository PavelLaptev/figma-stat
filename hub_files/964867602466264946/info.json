But with components such as dropdowns, in general, you might be okay with having some “default” content to start with, with an option to override this with a custom content if it's needed. And this is where Placeholder Component’s younger cousin comes in.

I'm mostly focusing on fast iteration, detaching fewer components, and — in general — being more aligned with code through the use of layers &amp; component architecture.</p><p><br></p><p>All of the past and upcoming videos can be found on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1v8FJXowbm0Q2hTHjq2wMg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Channel </a>and my Twitter account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamPrzewoski\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">@AdamPrzewoski</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Rather than being a tutor, I'd love to sparkle the discussion on how we use Figma on daily basis. I'd love to get your perspectives on my methods and get you to share yours so that we can learn from each other.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/964867602466264946"}
