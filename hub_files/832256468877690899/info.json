I had initially conceived it as a pure data-focused dashboard, but then changed the concept to a sequence of sections that tell a (scary) story. The data on the live site automatically updates (in this static file it won't, of course) and I'm updating the static page content as the situation changes.\n\nI also split the page into individual sections so they can be clicked through as a prototype in the file preview. Really nice how prototypes also work well for presentations.\n\nAttributions to the work of others is on the last page of the prototype. Big thanks to them.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/832256468877690899"}
