We heard so many positive comments on our idea shot for this app on social media, that we decided to create a complete app, but in dark mode using a popular style called Neumorphism.</p><p><br></p><p>We created 31+ screens for you to use it, but there is more. The app is fully customizable, which means that we created components/symbols very carefully for every popular design software Adobe XD, Figma &amp; Sketch. So now you can just drag and drop and create more screens or even some completely different app with ease.</p><p><br></p><p>All layers are labeled properly, typography and colors are also easily changeable on all screens.</p><p>We use Google fonts in our projects and in this case, we used popular Poppins font, which is completely free to download.</p><p><br></p><p>As a bonus, we also included a set of FREE 60+ icons withing this UI Kit.</p><p><br></p><p>We will highly appreciate your support and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us in the comments section below, or email us directly at support@broworks.net and we will be more than happy to help you.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/996731982448400977"}
