The current landing page (https://web.getmonero.org/downloads/), is a big list of all available downloads, but doesn't explain or show the wallet features. This landing page takes the opposite approach and explains primary features and different use cases.\n\nThis is a concept and would need to be refined before development (visuals, copy, navigation, etc).","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/777795091326592296"}
