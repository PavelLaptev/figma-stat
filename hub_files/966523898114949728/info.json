We like it very much so we decided to share it onto this amazing Figma Community! <strong>Enjoy!﻿</strong></p><p>👉 We got rid of all the specifics and kept all the things we thought would be helpful to others.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to know more, feel free to visit our online doc:</p><p><a href=\"http://design.buzzvil.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Buzzvil’s Design System</a></p><p>And our <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/966523885772875359/Dash-%E2%80%94-Buzzvil-Design-System\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dash UI Library</a> (manager).</p><p><br></p><h1>Auto-layout everywhere ↔️</h1><p>Everything needed is pre-built with Auto-layout. It gives a better control on editing, ordering, padding &amp; alignment.</p><p>Auto-layout is a life savior when components start to be nested into each other.</p><p><br></p><h1>Variants is the new black 🖤</h1><p>Variants are keeping things tidy!</p><p>We keep each component structure as flat as possible so it’s easy to override properties. It also helps to keep the files light.</p><p>When we start having tons of variants for a single component, we use a nested Master component to rule'em all. 👨‍🎤</p><p><br></p><h1>Dark-mode ready 🌝</h1><p>We support dark mode for our entire UI library! We made it classy, but it's fairly recent so we would appreciate any feedback on that! 🙏</p><p><br></p><h1>Interactive components (beta users only) 👆</h1><p>Pretty much most of our action components are already wired up! Just drag and drop them from the library panel and it's already <em>alive!</em> We will be continuing updating this part with better support in the future. 🚀</p><p><br></p><h1>Conventions ✨</h1><p>Because things can get messy real fast, we've been working with clear naming conventions for consistency &amp; readability:</p><p>On library level, a component name will be as simple and descriptive as possible (Button, Radio, Checkbox...)</p><p>On a project scope, shared components will be named by using project name: [Project]/[Component]</p><p>On a page scope, components will be named by using the page name: [Page]/[Component]</p><p><br></p><h1>What's inside the file</h1><p>Components are divided into multiple categories that follow our Design System structure. Select a component and access the related page through the description link in the property panel.</p><ul><li>👋 Hello</li><li>🎨 Colors</li><li>Accordion</li><li>Badge &amp; Chip</li><li>Button</li><li>Card &amp; Banner</li><li>Entry</li><li>Feedback</li><li>Header &amp; Footer</li><li>Icons</li><li>List</li><li>Modal</li><li>Progress</li><li>Tab</li><li>Texts</li><li>Toggle</li><li>Support UI (Android / iOS)</li></ul>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/966523898114949728"}
