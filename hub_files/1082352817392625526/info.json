I then learned how-to at Mozilla when refreshing Pockets' light, dark, and sepia reading modes. Themes were around but not mainstream. Then iOS and Android hit us at the device level, and they went viral.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Sadly, many products are still without dark mode, let alone multiple themes. If the functionality isn't already there, it can be tough to get buy-in from partners to build it now. 'The value isn't clear,' or as I've deduced, the pushback is often due to the crippling tech debt under the rug. Well, I thank Robinhood because they proved its value long ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The most tedious part of theme design is mapping the hex codes. After a couple of times, it's likely not something you'll want to do again. So, I created pre-mapped light and dark mode #Figma libraries that I can duplicate, give a quick brand refresh, and flip all my artboards back and forth between light and dark mode.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1082352817392625526"}
