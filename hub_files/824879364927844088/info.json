Feel free to use this any way you'd like, Just remove the logo at the top. You don't need to put my name on any derivitive works, but I' wouldn't mind a shout out on twiter or slack if you like the file.\n\nI can't wait to see what you make. I'm also open to recipe requests. I, or we, can add them as templates.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/824879364927844088"}
