Historically, however, many of the burdens in treating this problem have been placed on its victims, who were expected to come forward and speak up. As I will argue, the experience with bias and the burdens it places on the impacted individual are inherently connected with burnout in the workplace.

Bias and burnout, and the environments leading to “imposter syndrome,” must all be treated as systemic, organizational and cultural problems, and relieve the individual from the burdens they present.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/961762366299977438"}
