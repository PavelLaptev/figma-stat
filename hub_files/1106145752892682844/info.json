Some of the users will see version A and some will see version B. After a few users have visited you can evaluate how both versions performed in comparison to each other. There is a variety of tools/resources that help you to carry out the test, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.figpii.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>FigPii</strong></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trbo.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>trbo</strong></a>.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Step-by-step</strong></h2><ol><li>Identify your web page's most-traffic-areas.
