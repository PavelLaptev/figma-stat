Figma file has all the instructions inside which is convenient :)</p><p><br></p><p>• Single Customization Panel</p><p>Every brand has it’s own face, there’s no one solution that fits all, that’s why everything is customizable from a single panel. Set your colors, fonts, line thickness and even corner radius—all that will be applied to the whole form instantly</p><p><br></p><p>• Fully Adaptive</p><p>Each and every component is 100% adaptive with a minimum supported resolution of 336px, which is great for mobile forms. Maximum resolution is not really limited, but the recommendation for desktop forms would be 720px</p><p><br></p><p>• One &amp; Two Column Support</p><p>Some forms require having two columns of blocks.
