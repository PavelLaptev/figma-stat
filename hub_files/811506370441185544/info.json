The logo is made up of two rows of four books each, each containing a letter of the company name Bookclub. \n\nThe symbolism is made clear by rotating each letter. The leaning books make up a clever zigzag pattern that can be sprinkled throughout the product.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/811506370441185544"}
