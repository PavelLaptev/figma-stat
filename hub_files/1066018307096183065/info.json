Let me know your thoughts on the comment. Let me know if you want me to add anything special on this design.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About me</strong></p><p>I'm a Product Designer and UX Designer with Eight years of experience. I love to solve problems, focussing on details rather than making some random UI. I mostly work with enterprise solutions, B2B software, SaaS applications, Mobile apps, and other challenging stuff.</p><p><br></p><p>Technology/Tools:</p><p>I mostly use Figma for Interface design. I'd been using Adobe Suits for a very long time in my early years. Besides these, I use paper/pencil for sketching, sometimes Balsamiq or other wireframing apps. For collaboration, I love Telegram, Slack, Asana, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not a coder, but I have good knowledge on how the technology and the design combination work. My understanding on HTML/CSS and programming basic knowledge helps me to design a good product properly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>My Portfolios:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/masum-rana-81929b38/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/masum-rana-81929b38/</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dribbble.com/hashirraja\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">https://dribbble.com/hashirraja</a></p><p><a href=\"http://themeforest.net/user/one_touch/portfolio\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">http://themeforest.net/user/themexy/portfolio</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~012a919783a54f61f7\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~012a919783a54f61f7</a></p><p><br></p><p>As I mostly collaborate with Western &amp; European clients, my English proficiency is good and I understand humours.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1066018307096183065"}
