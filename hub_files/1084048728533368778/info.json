For testing out your concept, it should be based on (user) research. The idea could be visualized in shape of a low-fidelity prototype that includes its most important features. After the test, all main findings should be documented and discussed.</p><p><br></p><h2>Step-by-step</h2><ol><li>Have your low-fidelity prototype ready to test. This prototype can be very simple (think of LEGO bricks) and is a tool for visualizing the idea at a very early stage. A paper prototype is also sufficient for this purpose.</li><li>Plan the user tests using the Concept Testing Plan. The worksheet helps to record your research goals, the idea or prototype to be tested, and information about the process and the user.</li><li>Perform the test. Each user should have the same time for the testing session (around 15 – 30 min).</li><li>Document and discuss results within the team. How has your idea been perceived? What you can change? Are there any “low hanging fruits”?</li></ol>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1084048728533368778"}
