For 1080p, that’ll be an image 1920px wide by 1080px tall.</li><li>Use an appropriate scale. Details in the overlay might need to be larger than expected to be properly visible in a Zoom gallery.</li><li>Export your overlays to PNG. This format support transparency, so your video can show through when the overlay is enabled.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Of course, you can use any tool you are familiar with to create overlays for Camo.
