User Needs Kit will help you organize your users' needs in a methodical way following UX research standards, while still being able to involve your team asynchronously.\n\nFollowing this methodology, which combines value-based sorting and grouping general discussion and dot voting, User needs Kit helps you put your user at the front of your upcoming product priorities to make sure you build something they will love.\n\nFor feature requests or recommendations, please reach out on Twitter to @jvrlvs.\n\nThis was deeply inspired by @mixpanel's Feedback Kit. Huge kudos to them for introducing these kit styles to Figma!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/830011003403590603"}
