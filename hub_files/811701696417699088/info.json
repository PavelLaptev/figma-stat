For gradient I tend to use the HSB scale, I will retain the saturation and black for both colours, then just change the hue to get 2 colours that blend smoothly. On the Lighter and Pastel versions you will notice I have dropped the saturation values.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/811701696417699088"}
