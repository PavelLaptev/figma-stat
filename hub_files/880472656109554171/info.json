You can select any payment method by adjusting variable <strong>Method</strong> and you can select between 48px, 24px, or 16px size by adjusting variable <strong>Size</strong>. I have also created a Color Style for the border. You can easily change all borders of your icons by simply adjusting that color style. ✌️</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/880472656109554171"}
