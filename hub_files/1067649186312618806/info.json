Our looney MLK collectables have escaped from the kitchen, on a mission to spread and spill some feel-good vibrations to your morning routine. Flying the coop sounds fun, but where have they landed? ü•õüçû</p><p><br></p><p>Our little Art Directors, the kids, suggested that we give the MLK collectables a home, a space where we can see them in their own habitat, the Milktoast World. We started sketching some concepts together with our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discord.gg/ej6R7a7WAY\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">MLK community</a>, playing with ideas and discussing the world.</p><p>Within that moment, we realised that the Milktoast World is more than a pretty visual. It's a conversation starter that helps spark our imagination, creativity and thought process about the world-building element of Milktoast.</p><p><br></p><p>We want to share with you the beginning of this world, an iterative place that will evolve and change with our story, a fancy way of expressing a living document that we are designing and adding to in real-time.</p><p><br></p><p>As this is a work in progress, we invite you to give us&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discord.gg/ej6R7a7WAY\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">feedback</a>&nbsp;and be part of our story as we design it with you. Alternatively, if you‚Äôd like to relax, sit back with a glass of milk and watch this space evolve, jump into the Figma file.‚ù§Ô∏èüöÄ</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1067649186312618806"}
