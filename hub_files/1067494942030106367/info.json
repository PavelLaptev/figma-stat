I was not able to make the adjustments to each graph when needed without needing a new component or breaking away. Due to this issue, I went out on a mission to figure out how to do better graphs in Figma which lead me to <strong>use Auto layout </strong>as of 9 months ago. This method now gives me control whenever I need it.</p><p><br></p><h2>What?</h2><ul><li><strong>A systematic</strong> approach to data in Figma</li><li><strong>Reusable</strong> single graph component</li><li><strong>Dynamic visuals </strong>that leverage Auto layout</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Why?</h2><ul><li><strong>Math rather than guesswork</strong> when sizing bars</li><li><strong>Easy to use</strong> within other components</li><li><strong>Rapid iterations </strong>across all instances</li><li><strong>Smooth transitions</strong> between data sets</li></ul>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1067494942030106367"}
