Therefore, I decided to mimic an app that I use daily, well... nightly. I mimicked the app called Co-Star which was made to give some information based on astrology and the horoscopes. To me, and the people I've known that has used the app, it has made an impact in the users' perspectives and behaviors.</p><p><br></p><p>Like I mentioned above, an app that I used 'nightly', because I see it at the end of my days, therefore at night; and I've felt related with what it mentions at the top as a guidance on how your day would go. I have used it as a way of helping friends who have felt hopeless, frustrated, or any negative emotions, and they have confirmed to me that it has actually helped them. Just by using the app at the end of the day.</p><p><br></p><p>Right next to the mimic portion, you can see the original version.</p><p><br></p><p>Hope you like it. ❤️</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1121111765138576993"}
