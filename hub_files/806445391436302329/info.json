Generally it’s best to use standardized icons that users already recognize, but cryptocurrencies feature some unique concepts that don’t have many precedents. The goal is to create a more standardized set of icons that can be used by any Monero wallet (and other projects as well).\n\nThis is just a V1 right now. There are more icons that are needed, and we could potentially also look into slightly larger, more visual versions that capture more detail of each idea. But let's see where this takes us.\n\nMonero is an open-source project, completely owned and managed by the community. It gets better with feedback and contributions from people like you. So feel free to duplicate this file and create your own versions of the icons.\n\nhttps://web.getmonero.org","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/806445391436302329"}
