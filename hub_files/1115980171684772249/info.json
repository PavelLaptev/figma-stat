Toll roads are operated by Jasa Marga, an Indonesian government-owned company. As a disclaimer, I don't work for Jasa Marga, the logo and color palettes are used for authenticity purposes. The company itself has launched a mobile application with the same purpose as EAI but I find the design and experience not pretty.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1115980171684772249"}
