I'm sharing my slides here ✨</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Communicating design systems</strong></p><p>On the surface, a design system is a collection of design elements: color, layout, typography, iconography, etc., but behind each is a series of decisions that shaped its current form. The result is a reflection of your team’s ability to arrive at a simple, single answer in conversations with the system’s creators and users. This talk was informed by a series of interviews with systems designers, and explores why, and how, communicating your design system is the key to its success.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Viktoriia Nikitina, Product designer at GitHub</strong></p><p>Originally from Ukraine, I now live in Berlin, and design things at GitHub. My areas of focus are design systems, design infrastructure, mobile, and dual-screen devices. As an immigrant and a self-taught designer, I share my experiences as a way to give back to the design community.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/893475303189726437"}
