I am a Product Designer at LaSoft - software developing company. We work with worldwide customers and make design for products.\n\nI was wondering how to collaborate in the Figma tool between team and the customer. Goal was to let the customer move to this collaboration tool painless. I decided to create simple screen with GIFs. \n\nFeel free to share with your customers to make collaboration clear and easy.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/817682378858061251"}
