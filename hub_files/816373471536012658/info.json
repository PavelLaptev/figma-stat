The underline was achieved by setting a height on an internal frame, aligning that to the top, then having the wrapper frame clip an outer stroke so that it would only be visible on the bottom. Since these are components we pre-fill a set number of tabs in the tab group which can be hidden or shown as needed.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/816373471536012658"}
