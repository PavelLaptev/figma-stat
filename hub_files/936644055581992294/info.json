We created this set on and off over a period of a few years, and we're so excited for you to use these!</p><p><br></p><p>Each of the icons is combined into as little pathfinder shapes as possible, with most of them being in one Union in its Frame. However, we did our best to make sure that the shapes are not expanded and are fully editable in all their geometric excellence.</p><p><br></p><p>Locations were not chosen randomly, in fact they were all in a set of icons that Foursquare used and that we chose to use as the base for our Material set. Some of the icons are very different from the ones in the Foursquare set, and others are less so.</p><p><br></p><p>NOTE: We are not affiliated with Foursquare in any way. These icons were just based on their old set and included most of the same categories.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/936644055581992294"}
