The concept of road tripping envisions collaborators riding along together, switching drivers as the project progresses. While one discipline drives, the passengers stay engaged to support and contribute ideas. After all, what is a road trip without a trusty co-pilot to D.J., open snacks and help navigate along the journey?</p><p><br></p><p>At WillowTree this analogy has completely changed our approach to cross-discipline collaboration. We’ll talk about how our organization is working to establish a culture that empowers all disciplines to feel confident co-designing. We’ll also explore techniques and share examples around eliminating ego, gaining trust, encouraging vulnerability, and aligning on a singular vision for a project's destination.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/966686694492294987"}
