And the tablet, which it is made for (mostly used by our users) is not listed on a Figma devices list. So I want to have touch cursor, but I can't, because I have to choose \"custom size\" in a prototype settings, and so I only have a desktop cursor.</p><p><br></p><p>Also some Figma users requested to have a default desktop cursor in a Figma prototype made for iPads.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1099279198871910552"}
