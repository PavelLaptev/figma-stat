The required skills are more about ‚ÄúHow do I use the Tableau UI Kit?‚Äù and not ‚ÄúHow do I use Figma?‚Äù.</p><p><br></p><h2>Save thousands of hours</h2><p>Starting from scratch on every new project is tiring and a waste of your precious time (I know you're busy). The Tableau UI Kit comes with everything you need to design beautiful Tableau dashboards.</p><p><br></p><p>1,000+ styles</p><ul><li>Feel at ease knowing developers will design consistently for all dashboards.</li><li>Don‚Äôt have any brand guidelines? No problem, just use the meticulously crafted styles already put into place.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>1,000+ components and variants</p><ul><li>Easily pull in the design components you want with simple drag and drop functionality.</li><li>Feel confident your prototypes will actually look like Tableau. All assets match as closely as possible.</li><li>All components and variants are built with Auto Layout 3.0, which enables complete responsiveness.</li><li>Default component not what you want? That‚Äôs alright, use the variants for more fine tuning.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>2,200+ unique dashboard layouts</p><ul><li>With so many possibilities you‚Äôll be able to get any dashboard built in no time!</li><li>Want to create a more custom dashboard layout?

Just watch the ‚ÄúHow do I build dashboards‚Äù video in the How-To videos section to learn more.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Implement brand guidelines</h2><p>The Tableau UI Kit is much more than a set of premade components. It‚Äôs a single source of truth for your team‚Äôs brand guidelines (Color &amp; Typography). No longer do developers have to wonder about filter and parameter formatting. Just to name two examples‚Ä¶</p><p><br></p><p>Simply document your color and typography preferences for every component in the styles cheat sheet and change the specific styles to match. Then watch the changes be made throughout the entire library.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>---</p><p><br></p><h2>Who is this UI Kit for?</h2><ul><li><strong>Tableau COEs</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî Get everyone on the same page with a single library.
