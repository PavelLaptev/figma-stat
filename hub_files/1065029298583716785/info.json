I tried the 30 day challenge from DailyUI!</p><p><br></p><p>To be more specific, there are actually 32 days worth of prompts. Each day has its corresponding page. Inside each page, I have the prompt written, as well as notes I made, and of course the final product!</p><p><br></p><p>Disclaimer: I was totally new to UI/UX when I first started! Since completing this, I have expanded my view a little bit more. I began to look into LinkedIn courses, and started some side projects. This DailyUI challenge was a great starting-off point for me personally, but it may not be a good one for all. I gave myself a bit of time everyday to work on this while going through my Fall semester at university.</p><p><br></p><p>I love that this challenge made me challenge myself in the visual aspect. I am excited to start diving into the UX world on how to better user experiences!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1065029298583716785"}
