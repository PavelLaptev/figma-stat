Kaja Skytte, Copenhagen based architect who runs a small businesses Planteplaneter agreed to work with us. Kaja is mainly working with interior design with focus on materials and the interaction with spaces. Planteplaneter are handmade in Denmark and are being sold mainly over the website or through various design/interior or plant shops throughout Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>The brandâ€™s&nbsp;vision is to combine traditional Japanese techniques with a more modern and Scandinavian twist to create a fun and eye-catching new way of keeping houseplants. The production is kept simple with only a few helping hands and a lot of the plants used are grown in Denmark as well.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1097214057653464830"}
