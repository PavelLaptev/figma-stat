The challenge was to create a page for users to sign up to something or fill out some sort of form, so I decided on creating a prayer request form that people can fill out and also have the option of creating an account.</p><p><br></p><p>Feedback, tips and comments are welcome and looking forward to this journey into UI.&nbsp;</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1037532979215570791"}
