When we needed to stay inside, I had to keep myself busy. So I thought why not have some fun with Figma. I had the Idea of recreating the other PO's + make an entire Design and Icon system. But who's got the time. Feel free to adapt and improve. </p><p><br></p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Ronnyâ„¢</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/979459629836452689"}
