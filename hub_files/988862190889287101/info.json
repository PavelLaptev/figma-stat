This includes exercises such as goal alignment, mapping, lightning demos, and more (we didnâ€™t include prototyping or user testing).</p><p><br></p><p>To <strong>start using this template</strong>, we recommend the following steps:</p><ol><li>Duplicate this template.</li><li>Create a slack channel (ex. #design-sprint-[projectname]) and invite your participants.</li><li>Write a brief intro on the sprint details. We suggest pinning the FigJam link to the channel for quick access.</li><li>Collaborate, update your team on progress, and enjoy!</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Feel free to let us know in the comments what you think! Weâ€™d love to hear how you used this with your own teams&nbsp;ðŸ’›</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/988862190889287101"}
