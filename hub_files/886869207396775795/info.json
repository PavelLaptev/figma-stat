These components contained many nested sub components. When it came to lists and list items we started out with a set number of list items per component but when we started writing copy with the client it turned out we needed to change the number pretty frequently. Instead of detach the components and duplicate the list items inside, I created this modular list item system that allows you to keep your parent components intact and adapt to new copy and design needs.</p><p><br></p><p>Hopefully you find this helpful</p><p><br></p><p>Documentation can be found in the file and on <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/elimuro/Nested-Bulleted-List-Item-Components-b0444049bd8e42edbd5be4ee818f0b9b\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Notion</a></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/886869207396775795"}
