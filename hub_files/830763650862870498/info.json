Of their genesis, Rams' longtime manufacturing partner Vitsœ, notes: \"Back in the late 1970s, Dieter Rams was becoming increasingly concerned by the state of the world around him – 'an impenetrable confusion of forms, colours and noises.' Aware that he was a significant contributor to that world, he asked himself an important question: is my design good design? As good design cannot be measured in a finite way he set about expressing the ten most important principles for what he considered was good design.\"\n\nThe ten principles are illustrated by products designed at Braun by Rams and his colleagues (including the superlative ET66 calculator by Dietrich Lubs), as well as his work for Vitsœ.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/830763650862870498"}
