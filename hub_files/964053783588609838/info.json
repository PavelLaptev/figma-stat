After extensive research of users and competitors, we started working on the design of the application. We made different wireframes to be able to recreate the different steps of the user. After the approval of the team, we chose a color palette, which was pre-prepared by the team. We also used green to accentuate important CTA buttons. We started working on the application. After the first screens when we register in the application we see a home screen in which users will be able to view and select Feeds divided into categories. After selecting a category, a screen opens with specific Newsletter sources. The user can be one click subscribed or unsubscribed. With subscribe, the user will be able to create and select their label to save the source. The application also has three ways to visualize the Newsletters to make the user journey even more enjoyable. Buttons have also been added that allow you to mark newsletters as read, leave them for later, share and add comments from users. The application allows you to add a notification when receiving a new Newsletter from the source. One of our main digital assets is our website. For it, we used the same style as in the application. We defined the concept and structure of the site based on the research we did on competitors. The menu consists of 4 pages, and this structure was chosen after a survey of the sites of 15 competitors.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/964053783588609838"}
