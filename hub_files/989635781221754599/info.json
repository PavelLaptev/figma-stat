This has the advantage of maintaining the links between the components and the library.</li><li>OR copy and paste components directly in your FigJam or Figma file.</li></ul><h2><br></h2><p>This library provides <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y29Xwt9dET0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">variants</a> of all of the various components, use them to denote things like \"this service is owned by us\" vs \"this is an external service\".</p><p><br></p><p>ðŸš¨ In order to resize the \"Frame\" component, type random text into the hidden text-box. This allows us to resize width / height independently and avoids scaling up the object.</p><p><br></p><p>ðŸš¨ In order to replace the database / service / user icon, place an icon component on top. This will not be necessary once FigJam is updated to work with nested variants (looking at you FigJam fam ðŸ‘€).</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Contributing</strong></h2><p>Want to improve these components for everyone? We're open to contributions!
