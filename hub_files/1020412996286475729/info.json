This page has animated elements that you can see the animated version in my <a href=\"https://codepen.io/nasser_toghiri\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">CodePen</a> account. My idea in this design is to refer to Gandhi's spinning wheel as a symbol of India's independence and to emphasize the symbols and accessories of Gandhi's character. What to expect from the tribute page.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1020412996286475729"}
