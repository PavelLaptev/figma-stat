On a given week, a crit is likely on the calendar.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>My earliest memory involves printing and taping my student work on a gallery wall –– occasionally nit-picked for my tape placement. Nowadays, I launch Figma and share my screen.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>My cumulative takeaway? Most were uncomfortable, lacked context, and repeated without variation. The format is often the same: a designer presents to the group, and in return, the group gives feedback.&nbsp;The more crits I attend, the more anti-crit I become. I often see a misalignment between the project stage and the feedback received.</p><p><br></p><p>I've noticed a tendency for product design teams to hang out in the pixels. High-fidelity mocks dominate the show, and the brain trust remains untapped for early-stage design problems.</p><p><br></p><p>I contribute the narrow focus to the shortcomings of the standard format. It’s all we’ve ever known, but it doesn’t have to be this way. I believe, with additional formats, crit can support all project stages, participation levels, and feedback types. Build your format with this free customizable Figma template and create the crit that’s right for you.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1079521873259872574"}
