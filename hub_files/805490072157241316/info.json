You can remix and customise this template for your brand and you can use the system you create to produce assets that stay consistent and coherent while growing and developing with the brand as well.\n\nA brand system helps your team have a unique source of truth when it comes to produce branded assets, such as social media posts and graphics but also web and app components.\n\nWith a brand system, you can update an entire visual brand identity by changing only a small amount of atomic components (logos, colours, fonts, and more). The changing will then propagate through the whole system once so that all the teams can access the changes simultaneously.\n\nThis is a first version. It's based on the concepts of Atomic Design by Brad Frost and it's meant to help you implement a visual brand identity quickly. If you want to give me feedback or need information on how to implement your own version of this brand system, you can contact me at davidegiovanni96@gmail.com\n\nHappy branding!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/805490072157241316"}
