Whether it is a way to prototype something, or a setup for auto-layout that makes it easy to use later, I like to save those things for later, as well as share them with those who are looking to accomplish the same thing.</p><p><br></p><p>This is also the file where I create examples for when others ask how to do something. It will be an ongoing file that will be updated whenever I have a new example to add.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel free to message me if you would like to collaborate and add more to this file as well. hparamore@gmail.com.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1076195717239976476"}
