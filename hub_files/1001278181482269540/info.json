Note, that this does not have all the up-to-date features that <strong>should</strong> be in a design system, and <strong>this is intentional</strong>. Students taking my course will duplicate this file to go through building out each component with all of the relevant features needed to make the design system efficient and scalable. For example, we'll go about adding all of the necessary states to all components, auto layout where it's needed, and adding variants! <strong>This file in particular has auto layout applied to all components.</strong> Next up, adding states across all components!</p><p><br></p><p>Interested in mastering figma?
