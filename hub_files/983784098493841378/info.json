Especially as we continue to work remotely, it’s helpful to have a regular touchpoint with each other. In the file, there are prompts to share details on the hard problems we’re facing, anything we’re excited (or nervous!) about, and even updates on life outside of work. We love using cursor chats, stickers, and emotes to make the meetings more interactive.</p><p><br></p><p>We’ve created a template out of our process for other teams to try out. Hope you like it!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/983784098493841378"}
