Inclusive products are designed to be accessible to people who use your product differently. Keeping accessibility in mind throughout the design process will ensure that you are accounting for all of your users’ needs and abilities.\n\nThis guide introduces four different types of disabilities and offers actionable steps that we as designers can take to ensure that our products work for everyone.\n\nMade with ♥ at Underbelly\n\nWe are taking on new projects.
