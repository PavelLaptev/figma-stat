An even simpler project proposal.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Clients love simplicity. Well, most of them. When everything is cryscal clear and most of the risk is taken on the service provider‘s side, the client can sleep at night knowing that he paid for someone who can do what he does best, while the client can focus on their business.</p><p>I‘m sharing this 3-pages proposal to you, dear Figmates. It‘s not one based on hourly billing. Counting hours kill creativity and drain inovation. And it is creativity and innovation that we designers need to offer to the client, not efficiency, nor counting hours.</p><p><br></p><p>The proposal contains a coulple of unique features:</p><p><br></p><p>☞ Fixed guaranteed price</p><p>☞ Three price options</p><p>☞ 100% payment upfront and a money-back guarantee</p><p>☞ An offer to include all third-party spendings on your side</p><p><br></p><p>I‘ve written a lot about why I pursue this rather unconventional approach in a booklet at <a href=\"https://freelanceshire.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Freelanceshire</a>.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/997810487285612466"}
