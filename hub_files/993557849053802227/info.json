The web application provides the ability to make online payments in various currencies, including cryptocurrency, and the ability to pay for goods in various online stores. I did a study of the&nbsp;digital wallet market and highlighted the main points that I included in this product and I described these benefits in the text that I posted on onboarding text on the login page.&nbsp;Based on the reviews of the wallet's users, I created a person who wants to choose the best option for himself and follows the path of the user, which is reflected in the CJM. To build a composition, I created a low fidelity wireframe and high fidelity wireframes for the screens. In the UI part of the design, I created components for auto layouts, as well as variants for displaying an interactive prototype in Figma and to simplify the future work on the design. The accent color I choose is blue because it symbolizes stability and is used for financial applications. I decided to use a readable and popular Poppins font and created a font styles for all design.</p><p>Thanks for a watching and have a nice day!&nbsp;</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/993557849053802227"}
