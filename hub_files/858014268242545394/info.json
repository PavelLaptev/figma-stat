All of us have encountered cases where we need to add something to a component but donâ€™t want that to show up in all the hundreds and thousands of existing instances. We finally end up creating a new component so that the existing work is not affected. This script solves this issue with a single click.\n\nYou can hide a selected layer from all the instances of a component \n\nUse the Force Hide script if the layer that you want to hide is part of a component that is nested in multiple other components and you want to hide the layer in all of them at once.\n\nThis script works only on instances and not on components\nCAUTION: When using the Force Hide script, ensure that the name of the layer you are hiding is unique. If not, multiple layers may get hidden.\n\nDo let us know if you want any additional features. We'll try adding it. Cheers! :)","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/858014268242545394"}
