It is focused on the development of an alternative technology for deep learning, in which algorithms are built-in to explain how data flow occurs, real-time learning without the need for separate phases of training neural networks and inferences.</p><p>Thanks to Usman Hashim for UX of this project ðŸŒ¹</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/884013390215749310"}
