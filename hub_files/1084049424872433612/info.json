Many companies fail because they think about what they do and how they do it, but forget to think about the “why”. The mission of why something is done should be at the center and beginning of any idea or concept development. After the creation of the Golden Circle, it is clear which original thought is driving one. This helps to focus on the essentials before further questions are clarified.</p><p>“People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it.”</p><p>– Simon Sinek</p><p><br></p><h2>Step-by-step</h2><ol><li>Begin with the \"why”. Why do you do what you do? Why do you do the activities you are doing? Why does your company exist?</li><li>The second question to ask yourself is: How do you do those activities? How does that make your company or offer special?</li><li>What do you do? What is your product or service? This is the easiest of the three questions because every company or organization should know what they are doing.</li><li>Focus again on what is essential in your process. Not on \"what” you are doing, but \"why” you are doing it. The question of why is also accompanied by the need to know who the target group of a concept is. Only afterward, the answer to what is done is developed.</li></ol>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1084049424872433612"}
