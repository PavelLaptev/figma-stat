You can use it for a pitch deck. It has a few components that let you update the pop of color and the brand easily. I'm not sure that the figma community needs yet another presentation template but I had fun writing the silly placeholder text and maybe this will save you some clicks. Good luck on your presentation!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1096665872939878820"}
