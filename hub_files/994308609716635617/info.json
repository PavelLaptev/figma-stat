Not Figma, not Sketch and no, not a pencil. With markers you draw something once and it’s done. No erasing, no fiddling around, no details. You get your big idea on paper in a few seconds. If it’s not good enough, you try again.</p><p><br></p><p>But there's always this awkward phase, where you've sketched all the main things, but you need a lot of variants, for overlays, different states and everything. Sometimes scissors are the solution, but without digital tools, you can't avoid drawing some things over and over again. Tedious and time-consuming.</p><p><br></p><p>But no longer!</p><p><br></p><h2>With this kit, you can enhance your hand-drawn sketches in Figma.</h2><p>You can use your own handwriting (or something that looks like it) by changing the typographic styles. All lines have variable width for that wobbly marker look and you can adjust the stroke width to that of your markers and pens.</p><p><br></p><p>So get your favorite marker out of your drawer again and save countless hours with this free version!</p><p><br></p><h2>There's also a <a href=\"https://gum.co/HNDJc\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Pro version</a> with more components.</h2>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/994308609716635617"}
