Not Figma, not Sketch and no, not a pencil. With markers you draw something once and it’s done. No erasing, no fiddling around, no details. You get your big idea on paper in a few seconds. If it’s not good enough, you try again.</p><p><br></p><p>But there's always this awkward phase, where you've sketched all the main things, but you need a lot of variants, for overlays, different states and everything. Sometimes scissors are the solution, but without digital tools, you can't avoid drawing some things over and over again. Tedious and time-consuming.</p><p><br></p><p>But no longer!</p><p><br></p><h2>Enhance your hand-drawn sketches in Figma</h2><p>You can use your own handwriting (or something that looks like it) by changing the typographic styles. All lines have variable width for that wobbly marker look and you can adjust the stroke width to that of your markers and pens.</p><p><br></p><p>So get your favorite marker, speed up your design work and save countless hours with this free version!</p><p><br></p><h2>Create professional wireframes, right here in Figma</h2><p>Use the countless components and variants to create and share drafts that aren't overly polished. Especially when showing early versions to non-designers, low fi drafts can help getting you the high level feedback you need.</p><p><br></p><h2>There's also a <a href=\"https://gum.co/HNDJc\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Pro version</a> with more components.</h2>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/994308609716635617"}
