What is freedom? How good is it? What happens if we get rid of it? How do different design systems deal with freedom (or lack of it)? I compare Tailwind CSS to Material Design and Apple HCI guidelines, and then I explore how we can apply \"lack of freedom\" into presentations.

And how do most tech companies use these concepts in their favour?</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/898329757469191621"}
