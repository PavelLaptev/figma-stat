Make sure you stand out&nbsp;‚Äî and don't forget to check PH's own guidelines:</p><p><br></p><p><em>It is best to use an image with square dimensions. We recommend 240x240. You can use a GIF for your thumbnail, but it will need to be under 3MB and not too 'flashy'. GIFs will only animate while hovering over a post. GIFs with strobing effects, quick cuts, unreadable text, etc. are not recommended and may be edited by the Product Hunt team.</em></p><p><br></p><p>Good luck with your launch!
