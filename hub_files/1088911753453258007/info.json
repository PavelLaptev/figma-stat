You can learn a new language and get a new friend instantly. Our app is designed so that you can find someone either internationally or next door to whom you can talk or text. CommTogether can also help you learn a new language by talking to different people from different backgrounds. You enter in some interests and you can even upload posts to your account. You can also find someone you can become penpals with, you can find someone internationally or locally whose interests are the same, just like with the texting feature, but you have the option to write to them!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1088911753453258007"}
