Thanks for stopping by!)\n\nHere is a small tribute for these bizarre trends of last months. Tesla Cybertruck and Neomorphism, both loved and hated equally!\n\nI doubt this new style will survive inside the real world. Adding complexity for designers and developers costs money and time. Softness gives low contrast and reduces the accessibility of the elements. I took all this Neumorphism subject more as a challenge to make something visually pleasant, so don't try to look for UX where the context is just about UI.\n\nSmash the like button to show some love!\nCheers!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/820537114134908500"}
