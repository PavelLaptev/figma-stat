Easy to modify with a different fill or swap the gesture hand/pointer. I recommend using these in any static interaction/UX docs to help convey that items are interactive and how to interact with them. Super useful for documenting component patterns for developer hand-off, or for general reference.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a little freebie for the community, courtesy of a friendly neighborhood product designer.</p><p>— @ponchofreedo</p><p><br></p><p>* Will try to publish updates and optimize as often as I can!</p><p>** This is a port from a Sketch project so I hope there are no quirks.
