It’s where we work, find inspiration, and express ourselves. It’s also how we connect with our creators. At Handsome Strangers, we approach design like a bunch of ants. Yep, we are bug people. Just like ants, our team of Strangers works collaboratively to create bigger, better, and more magical things together than we ever could on our own. So that’s why we chose ants for our quilt square. And because we just really like bugs.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/804803356212105088"}
