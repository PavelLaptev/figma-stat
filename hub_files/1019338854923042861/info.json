The problem statement for our team established that we had to design and implement an App to support self-learning students to find and connect to voluntary tutors in the tech field. Most of the high-level requirements were pre-defined by the program. I was the UX designer of my team and my duties involved going through the Empathizing, Defining, Ideating, Prototyping stages.
