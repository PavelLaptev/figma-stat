Thus we planned an experiment with two options to start the journey: a \"start navigation\" bar at the top of the task list VS a floating action button at the bottom. After conducting our user experiments, the results and qualitative feedback we gathered resulted in our decision to combine both and use a fixed action bar at the bottom of the list.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1010186398816563739"}
