Feedback is received thru star rating and text. Developers have problems analyzing big textual data and they don’t know how to prioritize bugs that users experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Solution: We used the Topic Modeling technique to extract the hidden topics from large volumes of text with Python’s Gensim package. In the future developers will be able to sort the most used words from topics rated with 1 and 2 stars. With those topics, developers will be able to filter words such as filter, camera, photo, video... and conclude that if word video was used 6000 times and word camera was used 200 times. The video should get higher priority over a camera in bug fixing because users are complaining that something is wrong with their video while they are using the app.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>But to confirm bug problems we have designed a Mobile app targeted survey where developers can use most filtered words from 1 and 2-star reviews and confirm the priority for bug fixing and the actuality of the bug. Users are kids who write incoherent sentences that is why a targeted survey is the most important part of this project. It is well known that people don't like to complete a survey that is why we have created a limited-time offer with rewards for completing a targeted survey.</p><p><br></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1051220754539237092"}
