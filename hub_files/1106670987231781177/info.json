A caption is created, then drawn by the next person, then that drawing is captioned by the next person, and so on.  As the file continues to be passed along the line, the message starts to get lost!</p><p><br></p><h2>Instructions</h2><ul><li>The first player remains in the file while everyone else leaves. They begin by writing a caption in the first orange section based on the prompt. The more detail, the more wild the fun gets ;)</li><li>The first player then leaves the file and tells the second player to enter the file. The second player uses the pencil tool to draw the caption in the first blue section. When done, they will select the caption section above it and click on the eye button to hide it so the next player can only see their drawing. Then they will tell the next player to enter the file. </li><li>The next player enters the file and writes a caption in the second orange section based on the drawing above it. Once finished, the third player will select the drawing section above it and click the eye button to hide it so the next player can only see their caption. </li><li>Each subsequent player enters one at a time in this way, alternating whether their drawing or captioning, until everyone goes. Create more sections if they are needed. Then reveal the first caption and last drawing or caption to see how accurate it is!</li></ul>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1106670987231781177"}
