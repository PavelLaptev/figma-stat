Therefore, my latest sparrow design system (Chinese Name: sparrow design system) is intended to be carried out in the way of open source collaboration. The platform is figma; My designer girlfriend and I will explore specific ways of cooperation first. The specification itself is divided into free version and paid version. Of course, collaborative designers are free, and we have to explore the division of labor and dividends;</p><p><br></p><p>But welcome talented and free designers to join my team in advance; There is also a threshold for natural participation, which should be the test of some interface design;</p><p>这套规范虽然已经完成了大量设计，内容丰富，但对于细节与完整度依然有很大的空间需要完善；之前如火如荼的开展工作，而如今需要真知灼见，步步为赢的精雕细琢下去。 因为个人长期都在从事“设计规范”的生产与制作，但深知此事不易。因此我最新的sparrow Design system（中文名：麻雀设计系统），打算以开源协作的方式来进行。平台是figma；我和我的设计师女友会先行摸索具体的协作方式。规范本身分免费版和付费版。协作的设计师当然是全免，至于分工和分红还得摸索；</p><p>但提前欢迎有才有闲的设计师加入我这个小队；自然加入也有门槛，应该是一些界面设计的测试；</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1095282953014011314"}
