Here are seven that I made via  <a href=\"https://www.etceteratype.co\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">ETC</a>, as delivered to Google Fonts over the past two years.  They all support a wide range of weights, and some of them have other axes too, like optical size and width. They also meet the <a href=\"https://github.com/googlefonts/glyphsets/tree/main/GF_glyphsets/Latin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Google Latin Plus</a> spec, which means wide latin language support.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1106380116066919419"}
