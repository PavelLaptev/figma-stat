It is estimated 40% of dogs and 30% of cats are overweight in Australia, so there is an increasing need for pet owners to educate themselves on correct diet and exercise routines. In addition, many people struggle to find their pet the right veterinary care and other services (such as grooming, and dog walkers) within their areas.</p><h3>The Brief</h3><p>You are tasked to design a mobile app prototype for RSPCA Australia which helps to solve the problems outlined in the brief overview â€“ i.e. pet education on correct diet exercises routines, and finding adequate pet services (i.e. grooming, dog walkers, trainers, etc.). The app prototype must adhere to the existing RSPCA branding and design language (i.e. logo, colours, imagery, iconography etc.) and must leverage modern UX design principles and trends to suit a modern audience.</p><h3>The Audience</h3><p>The audience for this app is anyone who owns a pet or is thinking of owning a pet within Australia. You are welcome (but not required) to specify/target a specific group of users if you choose. If a specific group of users is targeted, this must be clearly outlined in your User Research Report. The only exception to choosing your own audience is if a design concept variation specifies a specific audience.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/980966991586964664"}
