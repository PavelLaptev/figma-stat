I decided to focus on the components most important for building products. For example, I have ommited carousels and jumbotrons because those are not things I use often when building products.\n\nIf you see a \"hide\" icon next to a title that means there are hidden elements inside of the component. I do this to take advantage of Figma's auto layout feature and decrease the total count of components.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/813927476215386429"}
