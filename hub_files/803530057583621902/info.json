Pittsburgh will always be where I feel most at home, so I went with Steelers logo for the backdrop. While I'm not a huge sports person, it represents the city well and DEFINITELY connects people together in the community. I decided to go with bridges as the core concept because it's something all 3 cities have in common, and I like the symbolism for how bridges connect people between spaces.\n\nProcess:\n- I first discovered the aesthetic I liked through this simple golden gate bridge vector here: http://clipart-library.com/clip-art/golden-gate-bridge-silhouette-vector-22.htm\n- Then I created bridges in a similar style for Pittsburgh (Fort Pitt Bridge) and New York (Brooklyn Bridge) by tracing photos online and abstracting them where appropriate.\n- Then I explored a TON of different ways of bringing them together (you can see them in the \"Other Explorations\" page) before landing on the steelers backdrop. Ultimately I wanted to make sure it felt simple, and I'm hoping I'll be able to recognize it in a squint test when zoomed out to the big quilt.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/803530057583621902"}
