Inspired by <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec</a>’s Art Nouveau aesthetic, Gruau echoed the expressive line and controlled blocks of color used by his predecessor. Born Renato Zavagli Ricciardelli on February 4, 1909 in Rimini, Italy, Gruau moved to Paris as a young man, and took his mother’s name. His career started in print editorials, and he made his mark in the industry by designing the iconic <em>Miss Dior</em> fashion campaign in 1947. A graphic artist for haute couture fashion houses, as well as advertisements, Gruau garnered further acclaim for his poster design of Federico Fellini’s cinema classic <em>La Dolce Vita</em> (1959). He died on March 31, 2004 in Rome at the age of 95, and his hometown Rimini retains a collection of his work in its city museum.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/933644803804689563"}
