Sometimes it's hard to find a particular component and it may get frustrating at times. It becomes a time-consuming exercise and one could easily lose focus from the main project at hand itself. We have included a navigation menu inside the main file in order to assist with finding any components, UI elements, or a web page faster.</p><p><br></p><p>2 - Well Organized File Structure:</p><p><br></p><p>Since there are a wide range of Ui Elements spread across 15 categories such as header, call to action, features, pricing.. etc, itâ€™s important to keep them all aligned. We have arranged each Element category in order of their priorities and they all reside inside a particular file page, so the users can easily pick the element of their choice.</p><p><br></p><p>3 - Web Page Templates:</p><p><br></p><p>There are many ready to use web page design templates which include: Home pages, Product pages, Legal pages, Blog pages, FAQ pages, Listing pages, and User account pages and lots more.</p><p><br></p><p>4 - Mobile First :</p><p><br></p><p>Every UI element or web page is first built to adapt to a mobile screen first and then a desktop version is also created. All the elements can easily be resized to fit a wide range of screen sizes.</p><p><br></p><p>Videos tutorials :</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztlf7s9C28E&amp;t\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztlf7s9C28E&amp;t</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLfsanROPOc\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLfsanROPOc</a></p><p><br></p><p>Highlights</p><p><br></p><p>- Best for App, SaaS Product, Software and Digital Products</p><p><br></p><p>- 15 Beautiful Pages</p><p><br></p><p>- Files Included for Figma</p><p><br></p><p>- Vector-based Components</p><p><br></p><p>- Auto layout</p><p><br></p><p>- Mobile First</p><p><br></p><p>- Responsive Elements</p><p><br></p><p>- Easy to Edit</p><p><br></p><p>- Organized Layers</p><p><br></p><p>- Completely Editable Files</p><p><br></p><p>- High-Resolution Design</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/852668155752191601"}
