FOR PEOPLE, NOT FOR FASHION. My attempt to improve customer interaction with the site. Make it simple, clean &amp; minimal, but save creative and general brand message. I developed wireframes, thought out design, made an animation for it. Of course, I didn't forget about the adaptive, mobile devices and other resolutions. It's about web-design, UX/UI design &amp; motion. Zara provides fashionable clothes and luxury clothing</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/979274116448184081"}
