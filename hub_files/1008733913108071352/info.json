Looking for an online resource that combines Apple's Monterey Safari UI as well as adaptive color modes? There is no need to search any further!</p><p><br></p><p>This is a public Figma file I made because I wanted to have a resource like this on hand for presenting something that involves a web browser in the future. At first, I designed only the standard Color Mode for Safari. However, I realized the standard Color Mode isn't widely used, so I also built out an adaptive color mode that adapts the Header to the UI.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope you find this free resource useful, and please contact me if you discover any errors or omissions. Thank you. üôè</p><p><br></p><p>The Figma team is always rolling out exciting new features, so I'll try to retrofit the browser frames in this document as they are upgraded.
