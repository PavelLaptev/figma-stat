She is investigating how rituals celebrated in Chinese festivals, specifically, Chinese New Year, are passed down from older to younger generations and how these rituals are remembered by young-adult Chinese diaspora community members. Specifically, she wants to learn about the pain points experienced among the younger Chinese diaspora that may be preventing them from celebrating cultural festivals.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1061206973472312945"}
