They are basically paper-napkin-sketch level fidelity, which means <em>they aren't gridded, they aren't scaled to HIG/Material specs, etc</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>If you use these for any project, <strong>I high recommend you put a grid system in place</strong> (I like base-8, mostly using 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, and 128 pixel spacings).
