A lot of junior designers and students asking: how to organise art boards / frames / screens in a right way, to make them clear to read and understand</p><p><br></p><p>2. Other part of junior designers donâ€™t ask this kind of questions, but send their projects and files for review, and it is that hard to actually read their file, that the first iteration is always put everything in order, make a clear and readable scenarios and so on.</p><p><br></p><p>So I hope it will be useful.</p><p>Btw if you are experienced designer you can share your way of how to organise this kind of information.</p><p><br></p><h1>ChangeLog</h1><h2>15.12.2020</h2><p>Added file cover</p><p><br></p><h2>14.12.2020</h2><p>Published first version</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/920253259279592999"}
