You can learn more about it here: Read more about it here: https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-design-team/\n\nIt takes in three phases:\n\nLearn: Look at every job description you can. Learn from people who’ve built teams (run questions by other leaders). Build an understanding of which skills or traits could be valuable on your team.\n\nAnalyze: Use that understanding to build a comprehensive list of skills. Filter that list down to skills that the company genuinely needs. Filter that down to skills that the Design team should be responsible for. Then to baseline skills that every Designer needs to know.\n\nEvolve: Have you realized a new gap on your team? Has the company’s or team’s needs changed? What do you need right now? When possible, grow people internally.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/766883810351845384"}
