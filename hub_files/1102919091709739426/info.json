Are you excited about their visit? Well, at least they didn't come mid-sprint otherwise that would've caused havoc, am I right?</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>A trip of a lifetime</strong></h3><p>Would you give up 15 years on Earth in exchange for a 2-week trip with an Alien to the ends of the Universe? A chilling icebreaker, isn't it?</p><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>A helping&nbsp;hand</strong></h3><p>Rumours are that these aliens have visited Earth before and have helped us build some magnificent structures like the pyramids. Like it or not, let's reflect on what went well.</p><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>But what if...?</strong></h3><p>There are also other theories that once this portal to extraterrestrial life opens up, some unfriendly aliens can escape into our reality. If that happens, that will certainly not go down well. Anyway, that's a 'what if'. For now, perhaps jot down things that didn't go well during the last sprint?</p><p><br></p><p>That's it.
