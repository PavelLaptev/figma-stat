We are a collection of developers hungry to discover and create new solutions that benefit all! With all of this diverse thinking involved, we thought what better way to bring ideas together than by creating a design system that supports this immense amount of contributions.</p><p><br></p><p>The goal for this project is to create an ever-changing system that every contributor can use to make UI contributions with ease. Although this is intended to be a solid platform, we are always looking for new ideas on how to improve.</p><p><br></p><p>All feedback is welcome! It doesn't matter what your background is in, we want to hear your thoughts. We will only improve by getting feedback from different perspectives, so don't be shy!</p><p><br></p><p>Have a suggestion? <a href=\"https://github.com/asyncapi/brand/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=enhancement&amp;template=enhancement.md\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Submit your ideas here!</a></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1063884118307396147"}
