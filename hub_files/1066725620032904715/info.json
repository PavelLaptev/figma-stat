I needed a simple-to-parse, easy-to-update way to keep my stakeholders informed on progress and able to ask questions and feedback on the plan as quickly as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>So I created a design sprint read-out template that I could use to keep people up to speed in the most lightweight possible.</p><p><br></p><p>This simple template only has four pages for quick snackability. Keeping it short means that it also forces the creator to think incredibly intentionally about what is included and how to frame it.</p><p><br></p><p>It also includes a real-life example so that it is easier for you to understand how I actually used this template and how it drove value.</p><p><br></p><p>~</p><p>from <a href=\"http://www.iamnotmypixels.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">I Am Not My Pixels</a></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1066725620032904715"}
