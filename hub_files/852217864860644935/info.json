It has its own market and its own economy, composed of real people. As it continues to develop, this world will only become more detailed, with additional features and complexity. Sometimes, just like in real life, it takes more than a few sets of hands to make that complexity accessible to everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Luckily our community of Uplanders is filled with would-be authors, publishers, streamers, designers, and even entrepreneurial minds who produce their own content, creations, and business ideas. Some of them do so to help newcomers while others create materials simply because they love discussing their achievements and strategies. There are also Uplanders who spark creativity and would just enjoy seeing their ideas integrated into the game.</p><p><br></p><p>We want to reward and also promote this type of participation in our community, which is why today we are glad to announce: the Upland Contributor Network (UCN).</p><p><br></p><p>UCN will be a hand-selected network. It will involve an application and vetting process to ensure certain quality requirements are met. We plan to have contributors from many kinds of categories, with the first program being “Broadcasters”.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/852217864860644935"}
