Do you want others to see your face but find that your profile picture is too bright and unnatural? Do you want to promote your \"brand\" in a Zoom call but think it's awkward to just display your name?</p><p><br></p><p>Try creating your own custom Zoom avatar! A dark overlay mutes your photo so that it's not too stark. A circle avatar compared to the typical rectangle is gentler on the eyes.
