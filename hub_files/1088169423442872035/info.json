So I created a concept Mac Studio Pro and a Mac Mini which I also <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1086862544865098585/Mac-Mini-and-Mac-Studio-Pro-Concepts\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">published to the community</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>The Mac Mini however I felt could use a majour re-design. I really liked the direction Apple took with the new 24\" iMac. Bringing back the colour into the personal computer for the non-pro consumers was a great idea.</p><p><br></p><p>So I set out to do the same with the Mac Mini. Since the Mini usually sits on the desk next to other objects i wanted it to look very friendly. So i made the edges completely round while keeping the overall footprint identical to the current Mac Mini and Mac Studio.</p><p><br></p><p>The port layout in the back is very similar to the Mac Studio minus a Thunderbolt. The power cable is the same as the current Mac Mini and not the 3 prong one on the Mac Studio.</p><p><br></p><p>On top of the device yo see the apple logo in the same finish as the iMac</p><p><br></p><p>Underneath the device I added 2 slots. The front takes the cold air in and the rear vent exhausts the hot air from the M2 or M2 Pro chips.</p><p><br></p><p>The vents and the legs are inspired by the new MacBook Pro 14\" and 16\". The legs should provide enough ground clearance to ensure a nice airflow. I didn't go with the circular grip of the Mac Studio since at this size there were no major benefits to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Next to the air vents there is a slightly darker line going around the device. This is where all the antennas will be just like the Mac Studio.</p><p><br></p><p>For the colours I used the same one from the 24\" iMac. This way you can match it with an iMac that you already own.</p><p><br></p><p>Update March 30 2022: Added a noise to all devices to look more realistic when you zoom in.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1088169423442872035"}
