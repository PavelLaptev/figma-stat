Various UX methods help to test these hypotheses and thereby falsify or verify them. The Hypothesis Testing worksheet offers a simple way of recording hypotheses, assigning them to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://uxtoolkit.merck.design/methods/personas\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Personas</strong></a>, and a specific testing method.
