It's an internal event where people get together to work on something outside of their day-to-day work to improve Figma. \n\nIn April 2019, a few of us got together to explore a concept around providing analytics for Design Systems. We did some lean research through twitter, designed some concepts, and managed to build a working prototype in just a few days! \n\nAfter positive response internally, we decided to officially staff the team, where Tom Lowry did a fantastic job designing the feature along with some very talented engineers. You can read more about the launch here: https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-design-system-analytics/\n\nThis document is the final presentation we made to explain our concept to the company during the Maker Week presentation, and we hope it gives you a fun behind the scenes look into how we think about designing product improvements for Figma.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/779132474532251985"}
