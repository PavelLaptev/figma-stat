MoMA’s digital product team is responsible for the user interface, user experience, and information architecture across all public-facing digital surfaces (e.g. moma.org, in gallery technologies, and digital signage) reaching millions of people who interact with the Museum both on-site and online. With this comes the challenges of creating holistic visitor journeys across digital and physical touch points, balancing the needs of many different stakeholders and audiences, and thinking of what it means to have a museum website in the age of COVID.</p><p><br></p><p>In our talk, we’ll touch on the history of the Museum’s branding and design, the various iterations of our website, and survey the different surfaces that our team is responsible for.
