Over the decades, suburban gardens have declined and Australians reportedly have a lacking understanding and appreciation of how their food is grown. But luckily statistics indicate this trend is changing, with just over half (52%) of all Australian households now growing some of their own food, and a further 13% are intended to start. Thus, with this growing trend in mind, a large number of Australians need education on growing their own food (based on location and weather conditions), as well as recipe / cooking ideas to make good use of their newly harvested crop. Below are some useful resources on the topic of growing food:</p><h2><br></h2><h2><strong>&nbsp;The Brief</strong></h2><p>You are tasked to design a mobile app prototype for Sustainability Victoria which helps to solve the problems outlined in the brief overview – i.e. educating Australians on growing food at home (based on their location and weather) and providing recipe / cooking ideas. The app prototype must adhere to the existing Sustainability Victoria branding and design language (i.e. logo, colors, imagery, iconography, etc.) and must leverage modern UX design principles and trends to suit a modern audience.</p><p><br></p><h2>&nbsp;The Audience</h2><p>The audience for this app is any Victorian who is climate-conscious, or simply considering growing their own food. You are welcome (but not required) to specify / target a specific group of users if you choose. If a specific group of users is targeted, this must be clearly outlined in your User Research Report. The only exception to choosing your own audience is if a design concept variation specifies a specific audience.</p><p><br></p><h2>Device Medium</h2><p>The app can either be for a mobile phone device, (e.g. iPhone X), or a tablet device (e.g. iPad). The device size you choose must be outlined in both part 1 (3 design concepts) and part 2 (user research report) of your second assessment.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/980977631801564346"}
