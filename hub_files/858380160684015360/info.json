How about names? How about codes?\n\nGood news. Namecodes is for you.\n\nNamecodes is a fun Figma-based game modeled on the popular game Codenames! I mean...let's be real—this is just a way to play Codenames while we're trapped in our houses. That's the deal.\n\nHopefully you own this game in real life. If you don't, you should grab a copy—it's fun!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/858380160684015360"}
