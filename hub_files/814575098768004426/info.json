We wanted to know things like: who prefers working in the morning vs the evening? What parts of the design process do you feel most comfortable with vs challenged by? What’s your design super power? Are you more introverted or extroverted?\n\nIf you’re interested in trying this out, feel free to remix this with your own design team! Consider adapting it to questions most relevant to your team and what you’d like to discover. This makes for a fun onboarding activity for new team members.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/814575098768004426"}
