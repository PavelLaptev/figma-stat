Not sure about you, but our record was a thread with 278 replies. So does that really work well?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How it started:</strong></p><p>It may seem that Slack manages those kind of things pretty good, but apparently not when it comes to replying to a specific message in a thread.</p><p>However, as you may see on a first video, it’s not. You need a messy link inserted in your message and 2-3 replies like that make the thread terribly long and impossible to read.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How it’s going:</strong></p><p>A simple solution that saves those valuable seconds, minutes and, ultimately, hours. A classical yet elegant reply function that allows forgetting copying links.</p><p><br></p><p>What do you think, useful, isn’t it?</p><p>┈┈┈┈┈</p><p>Looking for a design company?
