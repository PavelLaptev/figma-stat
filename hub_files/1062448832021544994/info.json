So the user would reflect on the prompt question to see how to respond to it in their work. Some people do this as a daily activity. The reflection exercise can be done individually or as a group e.g. with other colleagues, or in a class with a teacher and students.</p><p>The deck is by no means a complete critical alphabet, but rather an introduction to concepts that a designer can reflect on while working. The deck should also be considered an invitation to create your own list of important critical theory concepts.</p><p>If there’s a new concept you’d like to see in the alphabet or you’d like to give feedback or make suggestion, please reach out via Etsy, LinkedIn, Twitter – @mamaazure or Instagram- @lesleyannnoel!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1062448832021544994"}
