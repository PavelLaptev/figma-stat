The site has a convenient navigation bar on the left, and a large informative banner on the main page. The project is more like a market (in fact, it is), so it is ideal for selling content. The fonts and colors of this project are modern and comfortable. And finally - the site also has a dark version, which looks no worse than light.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1117387726515708604"}
