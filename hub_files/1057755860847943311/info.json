I recreated an experience I had years ago in a design agency party, where there was a game-alike experiential installation to foster communication and networking (because we didn‚Äôt know each other). This is my adaptation of that delightful experience: a port using only Figma Interactive Components and my personal add-ons.</p><p>And It worked pretty good!</p><p><br></p><h2>Credits</h2><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://kathalonso.github.io/me/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Kathalina Alonso</a> for helping with the copywriting and translation ‚ù§</p><p><br></p><p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/danielarmengolaltayo/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Armengol </a>for sharing the original idea assets, functional requirements, and expertise with me.</p><p><br></p><p>TASTER (Original Experience)</p><p>Original Idea: BertÔ∏èa Fontbot√© (@negroazabache)</p><p>Development: Berta + Daniel Armengol Altay√≥ (@danielarmengolaltayo)</p><p>Copywriting: Carlos J Navarro (@carlosjnavarro)</p><p>Development: Xavi Vives (@_xavivives)</p><p>Production Assistance: Sergi Roige Mas</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1057755860847943311"}
