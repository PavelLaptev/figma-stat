Each leader in the company explains their function. This is ours for Design. We thought it'd be fun to open source our processes like this in case it's helpful for other teams.\n\nTori Hinn (Figma's Creative Director) and I collaborated on this presentation to give perspectives on both Brand Design and Product Design. In one hour, we try and cover four key areas:\n\n1. Our Team\n2. What is Design\n3. Designing for Figma\n4. Follow-ups and Resources\n\nWe recognize that it's unrealistic to cover \"Design 101\" in a single hour session (there are 4-year universities that cover this!), we wanted to scratch the surface on a few key areas we felt others might enjoy. If nothing else, we wanted to be sure people were left with the knowledge that design is more than how it looks â€” it's also how it works.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/825467304309879575"}
