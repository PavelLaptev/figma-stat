I wasn't sure if I had to use only circles, like previously practiced. I had to stop working on this because of frustration of not figuring out how to redo some previous steps done. Therefore, I continued through the next 2 exercises little by little, to see if the solutions could come up.</p><p><br></p><p>Eventually it did! I'm so proud of myself! üíõ It may seem like a 'simple' rocket. But, for me it is way more than that. I see HOPE for myself.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to be an elementary teacher in these subjects: P.E., Special Ed., Science, Religion, Math, and Language Arts. Why am I mentioning this? Well, because my designing methods were skilled in a different way. I used to decorate and express my thoughts with anything you can find at a school.</p><p><br></p><p>I only used technology for the basics: social media, video games, and for school. I never saw myself using the technology like this.</p><p><br></p><p>Like it? Give it a ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅ</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1111904163817599469"}
