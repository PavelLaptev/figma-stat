Created using Figma, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</p><p>Navigate the menu using PlayStation Controllers: use arrow keys to navigate around menus, 'x' to select, 'o' to go back. Focused on the added menu feature \"STATS\". This feature does not exist in the actual game. Currently only the \"TEAMS\" feature within \"STATS\" is developed. Working on \"PLAYERS\" and \"IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1075543300666457260"}
