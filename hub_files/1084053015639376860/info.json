It defines the project by describing the problem, that the product is trying to solve and why users are taking advantage of it. The user should not only be the focus of the product, but also of the Value Proposition. The shorter and clearer the statement the better.</p><p><br></p><h2>Step-by-step</h2><ol><li>Set up a team meeting in which you will create the Value Proposition.</li><li>Ideate and collect ideas using the Value Proposition worksheet, answering questions around who you are helping, which problem you are solving, how you are doing this and what your behaviours or beliefs are.</li><li>Optimize the wording of the Value Proposition until the team is satisfied.</li><li>Get feedback from the users and validate your Value Proposition. If required, you can iterate from here.</li></ol>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1084053015639376860"}
