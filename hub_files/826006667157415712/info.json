Instead, I use blocks to highlight and allocate time to things I want to get done at a certain time, ensuring I have an even balance of leisure, work, and activities. </p><p><br></p><p>Duplicate the calendar for different scenarios. You could also use this as a subject or study planner, or a journaling aid. If you find micromanaging your day works for you too, then go for it.</p><p><br></p><p>I just hope this helps you live your best life possible!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/826006667157415712"}
