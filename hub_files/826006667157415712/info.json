Itâ€™s not supposed to be a strict calendar of activities throughout the day, where you list exact times and plans for breakfast/lunch/dinner. Instead, I plan to just list the things I want to get done at a certain time, particularly setting aside time for leisure, work, and side projects. However, if you find micromanaging your day works for you then go for it! \n\nWhether you are working from home, or schooling from home, I hope this helps you in some way.\n\nStay safe and have fun","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/826006667157415712"}
