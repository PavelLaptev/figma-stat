It reminds us to start at a high level, and circle in on the details, without getting caught up in the weeds or specific timelines.</p><p><br></p><p>I would recommend keeping it high level here, and getting more detailed in your backlog once you have your milestones identified. Focus on the outcomes, rather than outputs.</p><p><br></p><p>Every project is unique, you'll most like have to make changes to fit your requirements. I have seen teams use the final themes as tags for their backlogs, goals as problem statements, and milestones as epics. I have also seen people use themes as themes, goals as epics, and milestones as stories. How this manifests into actionable items is up to your team to define together. Iterate as you go. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Have fun! </strong></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/971447908536638281"}
