Start high level, and circle in on your details. This template can also be refactored to break down your work tactically. I would recommend keeping it high level here, and getting more detailed in your backlog once you have your milestones identified.</p><p><br></p><p>We focus on themes and goals because our Why and your Whats must be aligned before we can discuss How we will solve the problem(s).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Have fun! </strong></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/971447908536638281"}
