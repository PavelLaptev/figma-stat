This version is playable over Figma with no additional materials. Roll dice, look at your secret hand, and trade resources all within the Figma File! Uses a card set from Blaise Vincz (linked in the file). See instructions inside.\n\nV2: Now skip all the setup by randomizing the board with a plugin as well!\n\nV3: Fixes city build cost, flips resources over by default.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/834302905869835373"}
