These takeaways were based on interviews with designers, product managers, and developers; these <strong>\"modes of collaboration\"</strong> represent the different mindsets people bring to their cross-functional relationships. </p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the workshop transitions to a build stage -- where each participant builds a <strong>“collaboration creature” </strong>that represents the energy they hope to inject into any team they’re a part of. The workshop is part learning, part reflection, and part sticker collage!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/967090709405972621"}
