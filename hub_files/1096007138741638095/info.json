The problem that the redesign is supposed to solve is that some users read through our current landing page and explore the product (the Augmented Classroom/ARC) for the first time and still don't see the big picture. Questions like \"What is the ARC? What are the problems that it solves? What is the benefit of using it? How do I use it?\" are not sufficiently answered by the current landing page.</p><p>As I am still relatively new to UI/UX (been doing it for less than a year), I would really appreciate whatever feedback you can give me :)</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/proto/P7GwtSRMWisoHW3WIANP28/New-ARC-landing-page?node-id=1%3A17&amp;scaling=min-zoom&amp;page-id=0%3A1&amp;starting-point-node-id=1%3A17&amp;fuid=1007560262976408358\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">prototype link</a> to click through</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1096007138741638095"}
