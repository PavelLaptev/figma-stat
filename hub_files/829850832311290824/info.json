Did you know Figma is perfect for remote ideation? I found myself duplicating this file with sticky notes over and over. Now it’s time for you to duplicate it! \n\nInside the most basic Figma file ever you’ll find: \n• 2 sizes of stickies \n• 4 colours of stickies\n• Extra-strength adhesion (they never fall off the wall!)\n• No unreadable handwriting!\n\n Cheers. ✌️","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/829850832311290824"}
