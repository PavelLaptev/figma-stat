Starting with a team alignment exercise and moving on to a brand attributes exercise, you’ll quickly get to the heart of what people should say about the brand. Getting this alignment down early helps shape all aspects of the brand - from big feature decisions, to the look and feel of the product, to micro-copy on the website.</p><p><br></p><p>Credit goes to Jose Caballer and the Core Discovery Framework for the inspiration of this template.
