As we grew in scale, so did our design challenges. Our visual language was exploding in all directions. It was difficult to identify one product from the other or recognize them all as one, under Gojek. Considering the vast cultural diversity of the SEA region, we needed an experience that would resonate well with our users – unique, relatable, and scalable, all while maintaining consistency. In the session, we’ll be taking our audiences through our journey building an umbrella brand, a cohesive design system for 20+ products, and the lessons we learned along the way.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1105894537859902009"}
