Rotation of layers (including masks), however, <em>does</em> work, so that's what this workaround uses to achieve the same effect.</p><p><br></p><p>A few pointers:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>The mask shapes need to be inside of frames that are square, since they'll always rotate around the center.</li><li>At a couple points, you need to use -180°. To do that, type in -179.9999...if you just type in -180, it'll convert it from negative to positive and ruin the rotation direction.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>If Figma adds support for animating the transitions between arcs, this won't be needed anymore. For now, though, it's a pretty flexible workaround.</p><p><br></p><p>Leave a comment if you remix it into something cool!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1058793397546387376"}
