Hopefully you'll find use in this as well!\n\nBuilt Figma ready with constraints, auto-layout and easy component naming and structuring for easy use. Also includes a lot of text and color styles to easily create any other screens you might need. \n\nThis is a WIP so please send me any suggestions for other screens or components you may need!
