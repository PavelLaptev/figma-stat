This will help more users create and download more informative covers. Because nowadays most of them just use stock or abstract images for their covers. For a perfect result, we can keep the proportions of the cover for all states, but this is not necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>Btw, how can you handle this right now?</p><ul><li>First, use top right and top left corners for information that you want to show everywhere: logo, your photo, contacts etc</li><li>Second, keep in mind that you have two areas that are not always visible: in the center that is overlaid by a photo on the recommendation page and on the left that is overlaid with a photo on the profile page. Just place duplicate information here.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Thatâ€™s all.
