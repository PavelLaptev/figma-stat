The focus ring extends outside of the parent frame, but does not take up any space in the layout.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This hack only works on one axis (in this case horizontally). The button, and its focus ring, will expand / contract to the right, but if you adjust the button settings to accommodate for buttons with two (or more) lines of text the focus ring will NOT expand vertically. You could, of course, set the 'Button' to a stack horizontally, and adjust the 0px frame to expand top-bottom, but then it would not adjust vertically.</p><p><br></p><p>Good for most applications of a button, but not all.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1017467695495911941"}
