I found myself creating these when designing GUIs for mobile devices so I've turned them into a template for others to use. This is the first version of this UI Kit and, if there is interest, I'll add more devices and UI elements in future versions.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/999707924353828261"}
