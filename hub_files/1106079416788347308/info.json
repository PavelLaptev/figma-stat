We know what to expect. They are very much routine at this point â€“ everything is a pretty standardized choreography with repetitive objectives, template pages, arrows and lots of boxes. Fun interactions, creativity and randomness become increasingly difficult to unleash. Non tech savvy participants often struggle to keep up, resulting in valuable input that never makes it into the conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>We decided to flip the switch and design a different approach: Mimicking real office spaces to create digital workshops that feel more familiar and are built on the strengths of collaborative creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>In our session, we talk about our experiences and learnings with our new way of designing digital workshops. We show how everyone can use FigJam to build digital workshop environments that are on-brand, creative and fun to use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Our session on YouTube</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/NcHCcyagwbw\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/NcHCcyagwbw</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Get in touch</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.niclas.design/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">www.niclas.design</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.marceltobien.de/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">www.marceltobien.de</a></p><p><br></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1106079416788347308"}
