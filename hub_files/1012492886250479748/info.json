This is great for folks who may be creating their own recipes but don't have a great way to store all the information. I plan on printing this out eventually on A4 paper. </p><p><br></p><p>This design is largely inspired and tweaked by Blue Apron's current design for their recipe cards. I've really enjoyed using their service during quarantine to try out new recipes. #notsponsored ðŸ¤£</p><p><br></p><p>Feel free to share this with a loved one who's gotten really into quarantine cooking, or customize the components!
