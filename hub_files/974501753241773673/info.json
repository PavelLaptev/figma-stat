This app will be designed for any UCI affiliates such as students and faculty. While giving UCI affiliates the accessibility to have their food delivered, the app should also help the users locate restaurants for their food, edit multiple food items in their order, fill in their general information for a one-time payment, review their order, track the bot or drone that is delivering their food, estimated time of delivery, and leave a review for given services.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/974501753241773673"}
