Ô∏è</p><p>Introducing my name is Feby, this time I will try to explore the design of the application for buying and selling various types of fish. This is useful for those of you who want to buy fish, such as fish that are currently loved by most people, namely betta fish for example.</p><p>I'm very happy to see the results of the design this time because the sensation of the pink color is so pleasing to the eye, even though in terms of design it's still ridiculous.</p><p>Don't forget to like, comment so that in the future I can be even better in the field of UI UX design.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1012710955188230357"}
