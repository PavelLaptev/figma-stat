Each time you ask “why”, you are forcing the re-evaluation of the position of your dialogue partner. While it may feel odd at first, you will soon reach the root (causes) of their behaviours.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Step-by-step</strong></h2><ol><li>Listen carefully to what is being said.</li><li>Ask \"why” to question the statement of your counterpart that you just heard. This question encourages to think more carefully about what is the cause of a topic or problem.</li><li>Repeat the same question five times to get deeper into the problem.</li></ol>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1106144537261417049"}
