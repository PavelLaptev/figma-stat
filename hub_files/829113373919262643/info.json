My steps on setting this up:\n\n1) Choose your base. light shadow, dark shadow for base components. With neumorphism, a UI element's base and background share the same color to create the \"soft\" effect.\n2) Apply X & Y dimensions, blur, and opacity.\n3) Add intrusions & extrusions. Use inner shadows for intrusions. drop shadows for extrusions.\n\nThen, tweak the levers depending on the depth effect you're aiming to achieve.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/829113373919262643"}
