Make it more real, more skeuomorphic, more tangible.</p><p><br></p><h2>Real</h2><p>Interface \"glass\" is ok, but if you want to copy real things, you can make it better. Textures ‚Äî old but gold. Use mud, fingerprints and dust to make more sense,</p><p><br></p><h2>Graphic</h2><p>This glass is more suitable for graphic design (or sweet dribbble concepts) than real UI. It's little bit overloaded with shadows and using png textures, so it will affect the page loading time. It's easily implementable in web, but be careful, optimize for real projects and always check contrast ratio.</p><p><br></p><h2>Adaptive</h2><p>There're a lot of parameters here, but I'll list the most important ones:</p><ul><li>Tune background blur, opacity of color and texture to make glass look different.</li><li>Tune black/white opacity in shadows to make glass correspond the context:</li><li><strong>Bright theme</strong> -&gt; White ü§ç &gt; üñ§ Black.</li><li><strong>Dark theme</strong> -&gt; White ü§ç &lt; üñ§ Black.</li><li>Change gradients and text shadow color in buttons to make it fit into your accent style.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Open to change</h2><p>Duplicate, investigate, change and publish to make it better and optimized. Please mention me if you're using this in projects. I'll be happy.</p><p>-&gt; <a href=\"mailto:nick.denq@gmail.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">My email</a> -&gt; <a href=\"http://t.me/qurle\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">My Telegram</a></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/959780973349645945"}
