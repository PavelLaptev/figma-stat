You may have heard about the celebrities, multi-millionaires, and investors dropping gems or famous people crashing the app. This is all true but there’s something special happening within the design community there as well. You can find your fair share of UX/UI, UX Research, Content Design topics in your virtual “hallway” but there’s nothing quite like Figma and Chill.</p><p><br></p><p>Figma and Chill is a design club with 8,000+ members started by Hope Atina, a Software Engineer from Houston, curious about exploring a second screen experience that goes beyond the casual conversation on Clubhouse. Every Tuesday and Thursday a diverse group of designers congregate on Clubhouse, enter a Figma file to create nothing related to product design. You may be scratching your head, using Figma not for product design, how, why? Well, it’s simple. It’s about connection. It’s about community. It’s about culture.</p><p><br></p><p>In this talk we will share how BIPOC designers from around the world are leveraging emerging technologies to explore design through play, create dope art, and connect the global design community.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/966865967467730814"}
