I'm Sivaprakash. You can call me Shiva/Siva. I'm glad you took the time to check out my intro card. </p><p>I'm primarily an illustrator who also dabbles at Graphic Design. I just got introduced to the world of UI/UX Design back in June, and i've been really intrigued by the depth of knowledge this field provides. Can't wait to learn more about it and see you guys over at Karan Kapoor's Design masterclass!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1024958060326746019"}
