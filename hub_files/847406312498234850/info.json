In that way the search for specific icons is pretty easy through the Assets panel.\n\nI (Jim Raptis) am not part of the team, just a big fan that wanted to share their amazing work. All the iconsâ€™ copyrights belong to the official Remix Design team!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/847406312498234850"}
