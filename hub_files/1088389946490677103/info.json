There is a function to filter the recipes near search button(e.g. filter on ingredients or courses), a search bar to type in ingredients or dishes.</p><p>Different tabs within the app on the bottom of the screen (as in Instagram), where you can see the recipes that you have favorited, your shopping list, and an 'about' page of Freshly Dropped. I also added comment page in about us page to hear back from you.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1088389946490677103"}
