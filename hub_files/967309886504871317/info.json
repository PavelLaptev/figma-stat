Every piece of this UI was built from scratch. I've used an awesome plugin <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/760927481606931799/Appearance\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Appearance</a> for the dark theme, and it works like a charm.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole work took me about a month. It was challenging but very fun!
