The page I coded in markdown for <a href=\"https://github.com/nasser-toghiri\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>. The markdown language has very limited syntax and not everything can be written with it. The language was invented for blogging years ago, but <a href=\"https://github.com/nasser-toghiri\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a> still uses it. The simplicity of this page is both due to the limitations of this programming language and the emphasis on minimalism.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1020417178392440274"}
