My name is Rachel and this is my first attempt in Figma. I am also new to the UI/UX world. I've had a great time making this. I agree it is lacking but it's just a little something to help you get inspired. If you know more about design I would love to hear your comments on how things can go. Feel free and let me know what you think below to motivate me to share more to you all. Thank you !!! </p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/981470430278063444"}
