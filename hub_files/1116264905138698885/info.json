I kept the amount of sprite low so that it's easy to customize.</li><li>A few color styles will allow you to customize the color very easily.</li><li>The file contains two starting frames, one showing the little character upscaled and the other one in the context of a page (loading/progress bar).</li></ul><p><br></p><p>It's a 30min first draft. I hope to improve it! So please comment if you have any idea to make this better. :)</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1116264905138698885"}
