We also conducted user tests to see how different button orders performed. We analyzed and published the results in an article, published in the following places:</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/theorem/button-ambiguity-alignment-order-a42736e25334\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Medium</a></p><p><a href=\"https://journal.theorem.co/2021/03/19/button-ambiguity-alignment-order/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">journal.theorem.co</a></p><p><br></p><p>We've also synthesized the results from this study in this Figma Community file.
