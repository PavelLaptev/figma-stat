Starting with a simple idea: as a music lover, my main use case on my Apple Watch has been the use of the Shazam app while listening to music. I’ve been wondering why such feature couldn’t be materialized at a more affordable price. That’s why we’ve designed this smart band, keeping discretion and simplicity to a $49 price point.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this project as much as we’ve enjoyed working on it!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/842012577837875515"}
