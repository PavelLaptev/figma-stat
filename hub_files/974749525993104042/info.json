The intention was to create a \"Qwertysaur\" by making a shape in one single attempt. </p><p><br></p><p>The rules were:</p><ol><li>Every shape must be made using a single path, and it must be a flat, 2-D doodle.</li><li>You cannot correct or edit the path in any way after you make the initial shape. </li><li>Add a circle for an eye and an optional line for a mouth to turn the shape into a convincing creature.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Make one a day for any amount of time to help develop your eye for creating interesting, organic shapes.</p><p><br></p><p>Each of my qwertysaurs has an orb that identifies it as either a land dweller (green shades), aquatic creature (blue shades), or flying creature (red shades). To me, that makes it feel like a miniature ecosystem. You don't have to do all that.</p><p><br></p><p>If you try this challenge, tag me!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/974749525993104042"}
