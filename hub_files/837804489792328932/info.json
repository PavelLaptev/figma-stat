With the Auto Layout feature, life has become so much simpler when it comes to managing these tabular interfaces. No more selecting tens of hundreds of individual cells or groups to make alignment or layout changes when there is an update to the the table. Everything happens magically now!\n\nHit Duplicate and start leveraging the power of Auto Layout in tables. Check out how we have structured and built the components. We would love to hear feedback from you. We have added some most important components as of now. Do let us know if you want us to add more atomic components. We'll try and keep this table as live as possible. Cheers!\n\nP.S. We highly recommend the use of Google Sheets Sync Plugin by Dave Williames for tables (or any data for that matter). Saves so much of our time and makes data management (real data!) so easy. :)","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/837804489792328932"}
