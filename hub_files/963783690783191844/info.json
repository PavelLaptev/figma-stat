This is possible thanks to Placeholder Components. Not a hack, not a workaround, not a single plugin is used. By learning this simple concept we can say \"goodbye\" to detaching components once and for all!</p><p><br></p><h2>The Fun of Iterating with Figma</h2><p><em>The Fun of Iterating with Figma</em> is a short video series in which I'm sharing some of my personal favorite practices for working with Figma. I'm mostly focusing on fast iteration, detaching fewer components, and — in general — being more aligned with code through the use of layers &amp; component architecture.</p><p><br></p><p>All of the past and upcoming videos can be found on my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1v8FJXowbm0Q2hTHjq2wMg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Channel </a>and my Twitter account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamPrzewoski\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">@AdamPrzewoski</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Rather than being a tutor, I'd love to sparkle the discussion on how we use Figma on daily basis. I'd love to get your perspectives on my methods and get you to share yours so that we can learn from each other.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/963783690783191844"}
