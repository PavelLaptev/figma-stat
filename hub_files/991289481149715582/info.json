Share it.\"</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This phrase is widely accepted by many without trying to acknowledge the reality behind it. Here, I tried to demonstrate the phrase with resemblance to a simple electrical circuit. Books (or paper, courses, etc) are a source of knowledge (power) and when the knowledge is shared, it results in enlightenment and inspiring someone to pen down another book to keep the circuit running.</p><p><br></p><p>Made this motion graphic as a part of Thinkific challenge on Dribbble.
