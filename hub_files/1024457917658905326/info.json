Think of following the recipe as a favour to your current and future colleagues.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How the template works</strong></p><p>In the pages toolbar on the left within the file, you should see a structure with emojis followed by a description. Use the ones you need, you don‚Äôt have to use them all.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes you might even need to duplicate a page. For example, you might have several ‚ÄúExploration‚Äù pages. No problem! Just name them in a way that is clear, and add a date (eg. üéàExploration | Aug 2021) to make it easy to understand if something is recent or not.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps using a different page structure would work better for you! That‚Äôs ok! Do that. But now you are using a structure that everyone else can follow.</p><p><br></p><p>To get started, duplicate this entire Figma file, then change the duplicated file to suit your needs.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1024457917658905326"}
