The text and icons and auto-layout components but not the button itself. That flexibility allows you to create buttons with varying spacing between the text and icon.\n\nAlso, the text, icon containers, and button base are defined separately to ensure that instance swapping works every time. Keep in mind that icons do not stay when changing instances. Also, set the icon container size you use most before implementing them into your layout.\n\nHope it helps!\n\nUpdate: Changed naming convention to work seamlessly with auto-animate. Just changed the instance name to match the instance you are transitioning to!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/834131235245048928"}
