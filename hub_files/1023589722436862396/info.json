It can be used for other renting projects by the way. Renting and sharing projects have changed the way people move in cities. We designed Rio with the data that we collect from other major apps and benchmarks. We defined and tried to solve the pain points for these type of projects with brand new interface.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It contains 45 well designed UI screen and 20+ components with Figma variants. Color, text and effect styles all defined well and used in the project. Also Rio uses 8px grid system.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Prototyping is an important point for understand the userflow. We prepared prototyping in Rio and you can tour in the project via just click the play button in Figma.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1023589722436862396"}
