I saw the potential to solve some of the following problems:</p><p>- separate window</p><p>- a lot of empty not used space</p><p>- unclear CTA</p><p>- the unclear distinction between client and customer support representative</p><p>- automatic termination of the chat in case of no response</p><p>- a well-planned protocol for chat missing</p><p>- no option to upload documents during the chat session</p><p>- actual-time estimate missing in the beginning</p><p>- no time stamps for the messages</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/881468220260993600"}
