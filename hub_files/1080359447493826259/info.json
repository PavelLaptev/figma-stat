It’s one of the most frequently asked questions for designers wondering about their careers.</p><p><br></p><p>I can’t answer the question for you, but I’ve put together this work-in-progress map of all the options I’ve discovered over time.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of these are well-known: _of course_ you can specialize by joining a larger company as a Design Systems Lead or UX Researcher.</p><p><br></p><p>But others will hopefully be new, especially for early and mid-career designers:</p><p><br></p><p>• CEO/Founder of a design agency, or tech startup aka a “super generalist.” You design the company that designs things for customers.</p><p><br></p><p>• Icon designer, a type of “super-specialization”. While usually not a full-time role, companies do hire icon designers on contract to put together a starter icon library, or to overhaul their existing one. It pays extremely well!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>• Prototyper, another super-specialist. As an example, Facebook hires Prototypers to develop advanced design prototypes in Origami, Unity, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>This definitely isn’t an exhaustive list. I’m hoping that publishing this will help gather more ideas, and inspire fellow product designers to think more openly on how they can generalize or specialize in their career.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1080359447493826259"}
