Everything is linked to its own component, so you can change the text to whatever you want :) \n\nI'm new to Smart Animate and Custom Curves, so I wanted to practice and use as few frames as possible. I'm excited to see remixes that recreate the animation even more faithfully!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/873269238213654650"}
