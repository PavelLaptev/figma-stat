The concept of IQ Bell Curve memes utilizes the horseshoe theory, implying that the groups with low intelligence and high intelligence often chose to follow the same goals while being guided by different reasoning. Those who possess average intelligence are referred to as \"midwits.\"</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1037853630295134216"}
