Typically, UX method cards are printed out as a physical card which allow designers to pull different types of techniques to help them in their design process. Taken a step further, digital UX method cards allow designers to pull method cards directly into their design files to interactively plan their projects. At the bottom of each card, you'll find reference material to find more information about each method.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/974700407723727517"}
