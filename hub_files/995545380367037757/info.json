Brown was also slightly modified to look less orange. (Someone at Figma likes orange too much?). Other cool additions to the default FigJam arsenal include black and transparent which would come handy for all your counting needs.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, and did I mention they can fit numbers of <strong>up to 3 digits</strong>? That's right, you can write any number from 0 to 999 on one card — that's a 1000 possible numbers, and that's not even counting the negative ones, should you ever need those.</p><p><br></p><p>The usage can't be simpler: copy/paste the cards as component instances from the Figma file directly into FigJam. You can also <strong>publish this file as a library</strong> if you have access to this elite technology to be able to drag the numbers directly from the components panel in Jam. Modify numbers via Enter or double click and switch between colors using the variant switching menu. Scale the cards however you want but the default scale should be good for </p><p><br></p><p>One more thing: they come in <strong>3 shapes</strong>! Feeling like using a circle, a square, or something in between? We got you covered!</p><p><br></p><p>So what are you waiting for? Click the <strong>heart</strong> button ❤️ and duplicate! And share this link to the file with people who like numbers too:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://figma.fun/Gofbnp\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://figma.fun/Gofbnp</a></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/995545380367037757"}
