Such safety measures include making students show their proof of vaccination email from Queen’s, Student card and Queen’s SeQure app self assessment before accessing certain school facilities. Making students show all this information every time they enter for example the ARC (Queen’s Gym) is an annoying, tedious, and time-consuming process for the student trying to enter the facility. The process currently includes the student having to show their physical student card as well as flip through their phone to find all the necessary information as it is not all in one central location. This process which must all be verified by a facility worker also can cause long lines due to how long it takes students to show all the necessary information.&nbsp; These long lines can be unsafe as they can lead to the further spread of Covid.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1092573421406453313"}
