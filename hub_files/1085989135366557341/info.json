A piece of this root was still buried deep inside my gums, causing an infection.</p><p><br></p><p>So, we needed to remove the remaining bits and fast, before the infection was going to spread even more.</p><p><br></p><p>As the doctor explained to me, a tooth infection can \"invade\" your brain in a matter of hours and lead to severe complications, and even death.</p><p><br></p><p>Why? Because each one of your teeth is connected to your brain through tiny nerves.</p><p><br></p><p>The infection can travel from the tooth to the nose...to the eyes...and ultimately to the brain.</p><p><br></p><p>Here's how to tell if your infection needs immediate medical attention</p><p>(1 tip I learned from the doctor)</p><p><br></p><p>If you experience confusion, headaches and fever, you need to go to the hospital right away.</p><p><br></p><p>As for my surgery, I'll spare you the details.</p><p><br></p><p>Let's just say getting stung with a big anesthetic needle in your gums 5 times in a row and then butchered for one hour straight isn't something you want to remember.</p><p><br></p><p>The most horrifying thing, however, was that, even after the anesthetic from the surgery was gone...</p><p><br></p><p>I couldn't feel my chin and my mouth was a little crooked.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1085989135366557341"}
