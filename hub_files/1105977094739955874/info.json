More than that and there are too many voices to manage. If your team is 20 people or fewer, have everyone join. </p><p><br></p><p>For teams larger than 20, identify a mix of participants who can represent the entire team. It’s essential that all design leadership joins. If there is room for additional people, select people across a range of functions and work teams to get as broad a perspective as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, for teams larger than 20, that suggests there may be ‘sub-teams’ that are also suited to this type of work.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Structure</strong></p><p>Each Session is around 2 hours, in order to accommodate focus fatigue when doing remote work. (Originally this workshop was all-day in a conference room.) Typically these are done one-a-day for four days straight. Two could be done on one day (with preferably an hour break in between). Do not stretch it out beyond a week—maintaining some momentum is crucial. </p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1105977094739955874"}
