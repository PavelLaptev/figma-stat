So my good friend Matt reached out to see how we could help and these resumes are the outcome of that conversation.\n\nWe are providing two versions and may add to it in the future. If you want to help and add your own version, feel free to send your designs and we'll add them to this Resume Kit.\n\nIncluded:\n* Minimalist Resume\n* Classic Resume\n\nWe've got some instructions in the file for how to use it. They are fully responsive designs and can be seen as a guideline to use on a landing page or about me on your website.\n\nFigma Tip:\n*  Mac (Control + G) to see the Grid :)\n\nâ€” Enjoy and share with those who could use it, cheers!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/826509588957755187"}
