I'm a UX Designer based in Berlin, Germany. I work remotely for a logistics startup, previously I was at TikTok. I love designing for users, I have a classic background in sociology and anthropology which is why my heart beats for UX research and anything with behavioral impact. Config22 is the first time I'm joining the event and I'm super excited. Feel free to reach out to me, I'd love to get in touch with fellow UX friends! &lt;3</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1105870470459048855"}
