Students, TAs, and Lead Instructors are included, but they don't match your classroom :/ \n\nWork with Styles to change the landing page appearance to your class' flow. Make a component library to easily administer the components amongst all designers and keep the interface consistent. \n\nAs a result of the workshop, you'll have created your class' landing page on your own style and using real content. Kudos!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/844865496642808229"}
