I was traveling around Europe, and the \"hygge\" aesthetic I encountered in Copenhagen really stuck with me. \n\nIt's also the first illustration I've made in Figma. I've (hopefully) gotten better since I've joined, but thought it'd be fun to share. \n\nI ended up flattening a lot of the masks and boolean ops shapes, so I think I'll eventually update this with a HOWTO if people are interested!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/767095031210643472"}
