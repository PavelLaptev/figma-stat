Or a clock? An odometer or compass? This file might help!</p><p><br></p><p>This trick uses the dash/gap length to calculate exact degree marks. This lightweight approach makes it easy to store all of the information for interval marks in a single stroke.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: Due to the dash/gap logic, this only works for intervals divisible by 2. For example, 5 intervals (marks at 72°) will render as 4 intervals.</p><p><br></p><p>Give some ♥ if you enjoy it!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/941890684694243960"}
