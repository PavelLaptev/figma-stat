It improves the clarity and presentation of information on a device or screen.</p><p>- When setting borders or lines, go for solid numbers instead of having decimals. Instead of setting a width to 1.14px, set it to 1px.</p><p>- Apple has a native typography called SF Pro. You can download it from their developers website.
