It just works.</p><p><br></p><h2>Workshops?</h2><p>Sure, you can go with this scenario:</p><ol><li>Insert basic personal info (name, role, age) together.</li><li>Set a timer and let everyone add their ideas for the first row (Daily responsibilities).</li><li>After that set another timer for a voting session. Ask people to put two (or more if it's a larger group) stickers on the cards that seem to be the most relevant.</li><li>Sort cards with most votes.</li><li>Repeat for every section.</li><li>You can remove cards without any votes. Just do whatever you need to move this forward. You're going to be okay.</li></ol>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/975847355476045694"}
