Sometimes you want to jump into a design file and for a design jam with colleagues; other times, you need to whip up a wireframe quickly to illustrate an idea. FigJam is great for many reasons, and its simplicity is one. It's this simplicity that makes it an excellent tool for conceptual designs. Concept Kit gives you enough elements to create any design but not too much to get carried away.</p><p>‍</p><p>Go ahead, duplicate it and invite your designer friends to have a play!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1086072916557133579"}
