Would I stop after 20 or 30 screens? Where is my limit? Is there a limit?â€¦\n\nI tried to change my style, learn something about rearranging elements and colors, after every row or Artboard(from left to right). Feel free to use the elements, have fun with it and maybe you try to add some rows. :)\n\nAnd yeah I know the folder structure is a little bit messy\ndonâ€™t look too closely ;) Have fun!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/858630654141189910"}
