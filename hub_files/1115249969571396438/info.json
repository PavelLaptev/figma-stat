One his second wife Meera, one his long lost Uncle Anna and according to the last will his first wife and their daughter. Three of the parties want the entire property all by themselves but the only problem is that, there`s no signature of Madan on any of the wills. There are only two ways to come out of this, one, to distribute the property equally and second, if Madan Sukhatme comes and tells which is the final will. And then the game begins.</p><p><br></p><p>Three parties find their own Madan Sukhatme, a look alike, Ranga - a truck driver, Hari - a mentally challenged guy and Galgale - over talkative LIC agent.
