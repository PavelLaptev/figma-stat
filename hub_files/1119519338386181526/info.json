Jitter is an awesome web-based motion design tool. We'll start off with the basics of animating by making primitive animations in Figma and exporting them to Jitter. Then, we'll take a more advanced design of an app interface, and animate a demo of it. By the end, you'll be able to animate any design you have in Figma!</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of the camp, you'll be able to:</p><ul><li>Figma Basics</li><li>Exporting to Jitter</li><li>Motion Design Basics</li><li>Animating within Jitter</li><li>Animating complex designs/interfaces</li></ul><p><br></p><p>---</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://stempump.org/camps/motion-design-using-figma-and-jitter-06-18-2022\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Watch the camp for free here.</a></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1119519338386181526"}
