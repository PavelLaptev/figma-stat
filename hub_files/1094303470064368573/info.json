It has served as a guide for strategy, a resolver of internal team conflict, and an excellent workshop for shaking up teams facing analysis paralysis.</p><p><br></p><p>The LDJ is a quiet workshop, meaning most of the time spent working on these items is spent silently alone. The workshop is designed to last under an hour, but I often find that I have to break a rule or two along the way to fit the teams' energy, or performance for that day. This usually results in a 1.5-hour-long workshop.</p><p><br></p><p>I can refine this over time but wanted to publish this template on figjam, so that others may enjoy the amazing outcomes of a workshop like LDJs.
