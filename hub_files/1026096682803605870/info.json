Until then there has been a series of newer iPhones released, therefore I decided to update this project to include all 5 official models:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>iPhone SE</li><li>iPhone X, Xs, XR</li><li>iPhone 11, 11 Pro</li><li>iPhone 12, 12 Pro</li><li>iPhone 13, 13 Pro</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Created in Figma, For Figma users. <strong>üìê</strong></h2><p>These mockups were made from scratch in Figma to support components and variants. Just choose the iPhone model, then pick a color from a list of official color presets in the <strong>variants </strong>menu.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, since these mockups are vectorized, you can <strong>resize </strong>it to your heart‚Äôs content, as long as you keep the scale ratio.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Not enough phone colors? Make your own instead. üé®</h2><p>Looking to paint the phone to a certain color that matches your graphics or background? Got you covered. Just go look for a certain layer name <strong>[Change this color]</strong> and let your creativity runs free.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Placing your screen inside is easy! <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/mobile-phone/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>üì±&nbsp;</strong></a></h2><p>Just find the layer named [Place screen here] and replace it with your real design screen. If the screen size of the mockup doesn‚Äôt match your real design screen, use the Scale tool (shortcut key is K) and scale it to match the mockup screen.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Don‚Äôt forget to get rid of the ‚ÄúText‚Äù layer. <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/writing-hand/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>‚úçÔ∏è</strong></a></h2><p>This layer was only there for one purpose: letting you know which iPhone models this mockup belongs to. So it‚Äôd be wise to delete it before/after you placing your designs inside.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Hmm... Black Glass, anyone? <strong>üëì</strong></h2><p>You see, ever since iPhone SE was released, all future iPhone models have Black front glass. I can see why they did it, but personally, I‚Äôm not a fan. You can totally tap the toggle in the variants menu and <strong>turn it off</strong>, then the front of your iPhone will have colors too. Bring back the nostalgia!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>If you enjoy the project, please consider giving it a \"Like\" <strong>üß°</strong>!</h2>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1026096682803605870"}
