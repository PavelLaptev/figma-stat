There should therefore be no other team between a Stream-aligned team and their customers/users (on the right of the diagram).</li><li>Team shapes should be solid to represent their long-lived nature.</li><li>Interaction mode shapes should be 50% transparency to represent the more short-lived nature of the interaction.</li><li>Stream-aligned teams should generally never provide an X-as-a-Service directly. Instead, data or services from the Stream-aligned team should be made available \"as a Service\" via a platform of some kind.</li><li>If an X-as-a-Service or Collaboration interaction crosses over multiple teams, it may be appropriate to use an black asterisk \"*\" to clarify which teams are interacting</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Remember these guidelines:</p><ul><li>Use diagrams as&nbsp;a starting point for meaningful discussion; they are visuals to drive conversations around needs and evolution.</li><li>Any diagrams you create will be a \"snapshot\" of your current landscape; use them to visualize and present potential issues that may need to be addressed.</li></ul><h2><br></h2>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1020627299699159564"}
