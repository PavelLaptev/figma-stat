You can freely experiment things, as you can find an undo button, if something didn't go as expected.\n\n________\n\nüß∞ Options\n\n‚Ä¢ You can adjust settings by clicking on the \"‚ñ†\" option (flex, absolute or relative positioning,..)\n‚Ä¢ You can double click inside an input field to zoom on the Figma object related to your code\n‚Ä¢ Figma styles can be displayed (or not) inside SASS code\n‚Ä¢ Images are generated as base64 background in the preview, but are not added to SASS code.\n‚Ä¢ Vectors are generated as SVGs, and you can display/hide them in HTML code.\n‚Ä¢ This plugin works best with objects using autolayout (support for spacing, alignement,..)\n‚Ä¢ HTML & CSS are rendered inside the preview zone, so you can easily see how your actions affect rendered code.\n\n________\n\nüóíÔ∏è  Notes\n\n‚Ä¢ Using this plugin doesn't change anything in your Figma file.\n‚Ä¢ This plugin is a WIP, and may not cover every cases. If you find bugs, or missing something from it, please feel free to contact me.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/760966234320559456","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/760966234320559456/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/760966234320559456/thumbnail"}
