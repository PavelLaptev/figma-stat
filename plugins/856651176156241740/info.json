(Not affiliated with either of them)\n\nOften times designs contain non-repeated distances, colours and proportions. Replicating these designs can be very tedious, and discrepancies in design and implementation can lead to \"split realities\".\n\nPrimarily, this is to cut out taking measurements, reduce design-implementation back and fourth and save time/energy even when the designer and implementer are the same person.\n\nThe code outputted may be pretty verbose, but each Figma Component creates a Jetpack Composable function, making the output very easy to refactor in small chunks.\n\nNote: You need to be running the server (https://github.com/CaelumF/FigmaToCompose)\n\nPlease don't hesitate to create an issue or send me an email for anything that doesn't work or if there's a feature you'd like :)","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/856651176156241740","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/856651176156241740/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/856651176156241740/thumbnail"}
