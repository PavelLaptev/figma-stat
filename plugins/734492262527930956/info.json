You'll no longer need to manually copy a version of what you're working on to a new page to reference for later.\n\nAny time you want to save a version, just make a selection and activate Time Machine. It'll send a copy of your selection to a page called \"Time Machine\" that keeps a chronological timeline of what you've saved.\n\nYour work is organized by date and time, so you can compare side by side as your work evolves.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/734492262527930956","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/734492262527930956/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/734492262527930956/thumbnail"}
