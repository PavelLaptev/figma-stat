You'll just need to import your config file and see the styles created.\n\nPlease note that the config file needs to be in a specific form:\nhttps://github.com/LekoArts/figma-theme-ui#usage\n\nOtherwise it won't work. If you have problems feel free to create an issue on GitHub.\n\nIf you want to help maintain/improve this plugin I'd highly appreciate issues/PRs!\n\nTheme UI: https://theme-ui.com/","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/797015796747379907","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/797015796747379907/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/797015796747379907/thumbnail"}
