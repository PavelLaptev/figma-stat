How does it work?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><ol><li>First, go to your Figma settings and get a personal access token (aka a key which enables you, and only you, to communicate with your files),</li><li>Then, copy / paste the links of both the library and the design files you want to inspect (those are the same links you use when your share a file, using the \"Share\" button)</li><li>After a while, you should then see a list of all instances found in your design file, which components are used, and which aren't. You can click on a component, in order to locate it in your library file (to do so, you must launch this plugin in your library file)</li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Notes</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Please note that your personal token won't be shared or used in any way.</li><li>This plugin doesn't modify anything in your design (it only inspects, nothing more)</li><li>You need to be a least a member of a Team, otherwise you can't really use librairies, and this plugin won't be useful</li><li>All the files you can inspect must be created by you, or come from a Team you're a member of</li><li>The bigger the files, the longer you'll have to wait ! So, please be patient sometimes :)</li></ul><p><br></p><p>If you find bugs, possible improvements, please feel free to contact me.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/926549834287292156","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/926549834287292156/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/926549834287292156/thumbnail"}
