This means you can have a mixed selection of top level frames, and child elements and the plugin will always sort them without throwing errors.\n\nIf you only want to sort children of your selection, enable the \"Sort Children Only\" option. Sorter will remember your selection for the next time you run the plugin in that file.\n\nOpen sourced on Github:\nhttps://github.com/thomas-lowry/sorter","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742038190980789811","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742038190980789811/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742038190980789811/thumbnail"}
