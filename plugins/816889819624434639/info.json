It will then align them in a grid by 10 columns with a 40px gap. Simply select your objects that you want to sort and then run the plugin.\n\nThis plugin uses color-sorter (https://github.com/bartveneman/color-sorter) which sorts colors by hue, then saturation. Black-grey-white colors (colors with 0% saturation) are shifted to the end. Fully transparent colors are placed at the very end.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/816889819624434639","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/816889819624434639/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/816889819624434639/thumbnail"}
