Find and swap styles and instances between masters with the same name</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This feature allows you to copy master styles and components between files, change desired properties, and quickly swap their instances between copies.</p><p><br></p><p>☝️Compare to <strong>Figma swap</strong> <strong>library </strong>with the DSO you can pick and <strong>choose specific master</strong> <strong>styles and components</strong> to swap. You can also apply styles and components swap not only to the entire file, but also to a page or a selection.</p><p><br></p><p>How it works:</p><p>a) Select master styles or components and <strong>Mark</strong> them <strong>as Targets</strong> in the library file.&nbsp;You choose which masters will be used to find and swap instances.</p><p><br></p><p>b) Apply <strong>Relink</strong> in the design file. DSO looks for any matching styles or instances in the whole file, page or selection (optionally). Matching is based on the full swap or master name.</p><p><br></p><p>☝️ Style names are compared based on the full path along with the folder names e.g. \"primary/opacity/200\"</p><p>☝️ Variant names are compared based on the full name with properties e.g. \"Button, typy=primary, state=hover\"</p><p><br></p><p>Use to:</p><p>→ Move master components from the design file to the library file</p><p>→ Move master styles from the library file to an external styles file</p><p>→ Link all instances and styles back to the library after importing library and design files from the Sketch</p><p>→ Create a duplicate version of the design system and selective swap instances to the new copy</p><p>→ Improve library with new components and styles versions and selective switch between them</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2.
