You can click on colors to lock them in as you generate new colors and drag colors to reorder. The order of colors in your palette can have a major impact on how the service decides to fill in the blanks. So, please remember to experiment with the order of your colors.\n\nThough the \"Normal\" color model is selected for you, you can try other models provided by Colormind. The \"Normal\" and \"UI\" models are always available but the rest of the list changes daily.\n\nOnce you stumble upon a color palette you are excited about, just click the checkmark and Palette will throw shapes filled with your new colors down on the page.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742549221432366731","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742549221432366731/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742549221432366731/thumbnail"}
