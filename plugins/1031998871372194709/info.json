You can preview this code live in the browser, and then copy the code into your own app.</p><p><br></p><p>See how it works: https://youtu.be/3WucRJ7B6h0</p><p><br></p><p>Here are a few ways we built Rendition to be unique:</p><ol><li>Simple. No GUI to use, just react code in one click.</li><li>Flexible. want the code for a whole design? No problem. Want it for just a single group, component, or button? That works too!</li><li>Code quality. We built this because existing alternatives didn't generate code that we would feel comfortable shipping.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Our goal is to make life easier for dev teams, so please let us know what you think!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1031998871372194709","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1031998871372194709/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1031998871372194709/thumbnail"}
