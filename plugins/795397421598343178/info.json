It only affects top-level elements on your page.\n\nFor example it’s great to use on pages full of icons for your design system.\n\nThe Auto Size feature lets you ignore \"width\" and \"height\". Just start LilGrid and hit \"Organize to Grid\" and you're done!\n\nThat’s all it does. It’s non-destructive, it only changes positioning of elements, and it’s a one-step undo if you need to.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/795397421598343178","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/795397421598343178/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/795397421598343178/thumbnail"}
