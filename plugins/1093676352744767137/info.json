This will go through all of your pages and create snapshot images for each of them. If your file has many pages, you can select or deselect individual pages.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Step 2: Go make some changes</strong></h2><p>Once you've got your baseline snapshots set, go forth and make some changes. For example, you may be curious what will happen if you change a specific color. When you're finished, click 'Take Snapshot'</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Step 3: Compare Results</strong></h2><p>At a glance, pages that have any visually noticeable changes will be shown as failed. The baseline snapshot is compared against the comparision snapshot to produce a diff image.
