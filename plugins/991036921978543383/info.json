Then I have to drag out the bottom right corner and eyeball where it approximately matches the same spacing I applied to the top left corner, wasting several seconds pressing alt to check spacing, and dragging/nudging the edges to fit. I find that this plugin cuts out a couple precious seconds of hassle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Plugin Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>All object types (such as shapes, components, text boxes, frames, and groups) are supported.</li><li>Multiple objects, within the same frame or across multiple different frames, can be selected and resized at once.</li><li>Selected objects must exist within a parent frame.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>‚òïÔ∏è Support the plugin</strong></h2><p>If you love the plugin and feel inclined to provide some small financial support to encourage the development of new features and bug fixes, that would be greatly appreciated. No pressure, of course!</p><p><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/dnlrj\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Buy me a coffee</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p>_</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/991036921978543383","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/991036921978543383/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/991036921978543383/thumbnail"}
