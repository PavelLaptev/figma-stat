It works based on style naming conventions: <code>GroupName[theme_name]/StyleName</code> or <code>Button[light]/Primary</code></p><p><br></p><p>The core concept of this convention I'm took from <a href=\"https://github.com/glmrvn/Appearance-figma-plugin\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Appearance Plugin</a>. </p><p><br></p><p>But this approach is not native to figma, and therefore adding each such style manually - is rather annoying and time-consuming, so the plugin has its own style and theme editor to simplify the naming process and quickly insert the desired styles.</p><p><br></p><p>This is convenient because you can work with one target layout, and then simply duplicate the existing theme, and replace the necessary styles - so you can quickly create a new layout variation.</p><p><br></p><h2>Is it stable?</h2><p>This is an alpha release, it implements the basic concept of working with themes, styles, redrawing. Most of them work stably, but this is not a polished version of the plugin, so in case of any errors and problems, the best option is either to restart the plugin or roll back certain changes in the layout using `Ctrl+Z`. </p><p><br></p><p>At Now the plugin is at the stage of polishing, and this version is intended primarily for enthusiasts to check it in battle, and collect feedback (you can leave issues on github, or write to the mail) </p><p><br></p><h2>Planned improvements</h2><ul><li>Create detailed tutorial video</li><li>Fix reaction bugs in ui side of plugin</li><li>Adding some validators</li><li>Adding simple text style editor</li><li>Adding style guides generator</li></ul><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/friktor/figma-complex-themes\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Source Code</a></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/953979671302711395","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/953979671302711395/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/953979671302711395/thumbnail"}
