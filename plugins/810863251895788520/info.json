Kind of like skeuomorphism in iOS back in 2007.

If you use pure white or black, it will miss one of the shadows and it won't feel \"neumorphistic\" anymore. I'll suggest to take a kind of bluish tint of white / black.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>‚Äî</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you very much for the kind help for the color calculation-algorithm from Adam, he built the site <a href=\"https://neumorphism.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://neumorphism.io/</a> on which you can generate neumorphic CSS shadows.
