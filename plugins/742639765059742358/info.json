Select one or more layers. (All layers need have a parent frame)\n2. Adjust either the Top/Bottom/Left/Right or the width and height values to position or resize your layers.\n\nChange position without resizing:\nSet the constraints to one side before changing the margin values.\n\nResize:\nSet the constraints to both sides (Left + Right/Top + Bottom) before changing the margin values.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts:\nUp/Down - Increase/decrease by the small nudge value.\nShift + Up/Down - Increase/decrease by the big nudge value.\n\nPresets:\nYou can create presets to quickly set margins and constraints by clicking the + button in the Presets section. By default the preset will include your current margin values.\n\nTo edit and rename a preset, click on its setting icon.\n\nOnly fields with values will be applied in the preset. For example, if you set only the Top and Right values and leave Left and Bottom blank, the preset will push layers to the top right without any resizing.\n\nHere are some ideas of what you could do with presets:\n- Place a close button at the top-right corner of a panel or dialog.\n- Resize layers to have 16px margins on all sides.\n- Resize a horizontal line to span full width.\n- Resize a vertical line to span full height.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742639765059742358","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742639765059742358/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742639765059742358/thumbnail"}
