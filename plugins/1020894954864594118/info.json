You can create prototypes navigable with the DPad, Left &amp; Right Sticks, Shoulder &amp; Trigger buttons or custom button assignments. It also supports Smart Animate transitions and swapping variants in your prototype.</p><p><br></p><p>If you spend hours on hours creating game or TV prototypes, this plugin is for you!</p><p><br></p><h2>Usage</h2><p><em>Generate Prototype: </em>Select component instances within a single top-level frame to generate a complete prototype.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Link Frames: </em>When not working with components, manually design each top-level frame in the prototype, then link them to create a prototype.</p><p><br></p><p>Prototyper will automatically create interactions for your prototype based on the relative position of selected elements. In most cases your prototypes will just work out of the box. However, in rare cases such as when prototyping asymmetric grids, you may need to edit the interactions to get them right.</p><p><br></p><h2>Open Source</h2><p>Prototyper is <a href=\"https://github.com/aashreys/prototyper\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">open source</a> and contributions are welcome!</p><p><br></p><h2>Contributors</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/atokmakchiev\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Tokmakchiev</a>&nbsp;- PS4 Controller Keycodes</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AntoinePlu\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Antoine Plu</a>&nbsp;- PlayStation Controller icons</li></ul>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1020894954864594118","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1020894954864594118/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1020894954864594118/thumbnail"}
