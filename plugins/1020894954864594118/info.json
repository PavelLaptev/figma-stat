It will automatically change the variants of the instances and link the prototype based on their relative position.</p><p><br></p><p>It's great for creating an initial prototype from your UI mock. Once generated, you can add your own interactions, just like you normally would in Figma.</p><p><br></p><h2>Link Frames</h2><p>The Link tab allows you to create a prototype from any top-level frames on your canvas. Simply select the top-level frames and click Link Frames. The frames will be linked based on their relative position.</p><p><br></p><p>It's great for creating a prototype from individual frames that you have already designed, or are too complex to create using Generate Prototype. You can also use Link Frames to add more input methods to existing prototypes... such as adding Left Stick to a DPad navigable prototype.</p><p><br></p><h2>Open Source</h2><p>Prototyper is <a href=\"https://github.com/aashreys/prototyper\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">open source</a> and contributions are most welcome!</p><p><br></p><h2>Contributors</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/atokmakchiev\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Tokmakchiev</a>&nbsp;- PS4 Controller Keycodes</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AntoinePlu\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Antoine Plu</a>&nbsp;- PlayStation Controller icons</li></ul>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1020894954864594118","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1020894954864594118/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1020894954864594118/thumbnail"}
