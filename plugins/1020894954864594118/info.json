You can also add Smart Animate transitions and swap variants in your prototype.</p><p><br></p><p>If you create game or TV prototypes regularly, this plugin is for you!</p><p><br></p><h2>Usage</h2><p><em>Generate Prototype: </em>Select component instances within a single top-level frame to generate a complete prototype.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Link Frames: </em>When not working with components, manually design each top-level frame in the prototype, then link them to create a prototype.</p><p><br></p><p>Prototyper will automatically create interactions for your prototype based on the relative position of selected elements. In most cases your prototypes will just work out of the box. However, in rare cases such as when prototyping asymmetric grids, you may need to edit the interactions to get them right.</p><p><br></p><h2>Open Source</h2><p>Prototyper is <a href=\"https://github.com/aashreys/prototyper\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">open source</a> and contributions are welcome!</p><p><br></p><h2>Contributors</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/atokmakchiev\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Tokmakchiev</a>&nbsp;- PS4 Controller Keycodes</li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AntoinePlu\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Antoine Plu</a>&nbsp;- PlayStation Controller icons</li></ul>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1020894954864594118","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1020894954864594118/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1020894954864594118/thumbnail"}
