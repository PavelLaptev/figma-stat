Fill rules determine which parts of a vector outline are filled. The fill rules have different behavior when a vector outline overlaps.\n\nWhy is this useful? Certain export formats (e.g. TrueType fonts, Android VectorDrawable) only support the non-zero fill rule. You can use this plugin to manually convert even-odd to non-zero to make the exporters for these formats work.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/771155994770327940","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/771155994770327940/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/771155994770327940/thumbnail"}
