The logotype will be added as an image fill to any selected element.\n\nHow does it work:\n\n1. Select one or many elements in your design.\n\n2. Activate the plugin and search for the logotype you would like to insert by entering domain or brand name.\n\n3. Click the logotype you would like to insert and it will be added as a fill of any selected elements.\n\nThanks to the brilliant people at Clerbit all logos are provided for free using their logo API. For more information about the API please visit https://clearbit.com/logo.\n\nMade by love by Richard Wålander (https://dribbble.com/richardwalander)","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/827609259425497670","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/827609259425497670/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/827609259425497670/thumbnail"}
