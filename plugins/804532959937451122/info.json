The icons set the latest gradient from the svg files with two or more same ids. \n\nGitHub: https://github.com/irodger/svg-id-randomizer\n\nTo solve the problem plugin adds 6 random numbers to ids inside the svg code links. This solution help to escape hand rewriting ids inside when you have the issue.\n\nWithout plugin:\n<svg ...>\n    ...\n    <rect fill=\"url(#paint0_linear) ... >\n    <rect fill=\"url(#paint1_radial) ... >\n    ...\n    <linearGradient id=\"paint0_linear\" ... >\n    <radialGradient id=\"paint1_radial\" ... >\n    ...\n</svg>\n\nWith plugin:\n<svg ...>\n    ...\n    <rect fill=\"url(#paint0_linear-231475) ... >\n    <rect fill=\"url(#paint1_radial-863795) ... >\n    ...\n    <linearGradient id=\"paint0_linear-231475\" ... >\n    <radialGradient id=\"paint1_radial-863795\" ... >\n    ...\n</svg>\n\nHow to use it?\nSelect what you need to export in svg, then run the plugin from the plugins menu. In the opened popup, you may see svg code (already with unique ids inside in case if the code has links to gradients).\n\nSad news, guys ðŸ¥º\nUnfortunately, Figma didn't allow access to the export dialog for plugin development.\nAlso, viewers role can't use plugins ðŸ˜¢","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/804532959937451122","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/804532959937451122/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/804532959937451122/thumbnail"}
