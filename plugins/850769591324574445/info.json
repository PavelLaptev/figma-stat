Keep up with your product's backlog with mindful modularity.\n\nðŸ’¡Mindful Modularity:\n\nUnburden yourself from the idea of having to build and maintain a monolithic prototype. They should be cheap, disposable, and serve only as a communication tool to validate user stories.\n\nNeedsDesign:\n\nMaintain focus on solving only the problem you currently have. NeedsDesign provides an opinionated workflow by displaying user stories that have a \"needs design\" label and creates a new page for each. Whether a feature or a bug, NeedsDesign helps to reinforce modularity in the design process and avoid the siren's song that is a single prototype that maintains parity with working software.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/850769591324574445","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/850769591324574445/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/850769591324574445/thumbnail"}
