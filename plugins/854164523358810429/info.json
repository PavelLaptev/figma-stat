This is useful if you want to quickly set an image but don't want to lose the other fills or style treatments (which would get overridden if you naively copy-pasted a layer's properties)</p><h3>Now you can also paste or drag images into the image well to use as a source.</h3><p><br></p><h2>Other notes:</h2><p>Originally I wanted to be able to use the clipboard as the source for replacing a layer, but it's not possible in Figma. If you're using the Figma Desktop app, you can assign \"Set Source Layer\" to a keyboard shortcut as well.</p><p>If your source layer is a component, it will replace the target layer with an instance of that component.</p><p>The thumbnail that's generated when you set the source layer also acts as a quick export â€” just drag it to your desktop to get a 2x resolution PNG of the source layer.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/854164523358810429","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/854164523358810429/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/854164523358810429/thumbnail"}
