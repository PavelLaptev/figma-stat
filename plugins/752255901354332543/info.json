You can then change the inputs to adjust the padding of the box.\n\n◾ Using your own box ◾\nYou can use your own bounding box by appending the \":boxed\" suffix to the end of a selected layer's name. Box-It will either use the first :boxed layer found in your selection or create a new :boxed rectangle if none exists.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/752255901354332543","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/752255901354332543/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/752255901354332543/thumbnail"}
