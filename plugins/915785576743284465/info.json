To use:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Draw a stroke with the pen tool. </li><li>Select the stroke. </li><li>Run this plugin. </li><li>Edit the stroke within the plugin window. This lets you adjust the stroke thickness. </li></ol><p><br></p><p>Because Figma plugins cannot directly augment Figma's editing tools, variable-width stroke is only editable within this plugin's window. Once you edit an object using this plugin, the stroke will be \"outlined\" (i.e. be replaced by a fill) when you go back to Figma. It's still possible to edit the variable-width stroke object again after closing the plugin by selecting the object and re-running this plugin.</p><p><br></p><p>More detailed instructions are available in this plugin's help menu.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/915785576743284465","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/915785576743284465/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/915785576743284465/thumbnail"}
