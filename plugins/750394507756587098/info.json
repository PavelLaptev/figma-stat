You can also combine multiple commands by seperating them with a comma, like so: \"l+50,r+20\". If you check the box \"Ignore Constraints\", the elements will be resized without applying the individual constraints.\n\nDeveloped at Syncier.\n\nThe following directions are supported at the moment:\nl -> left\nr -> right\nt -> top\nb -> bottom\nw -> width (same as \"right\")\nh -> height (same as \"bottom\")\nx -> x-axis\ny -> y-axis\n\nThe following operators are supported at the moment:\n+ -> plus\n- -> minus\n= -> set x, y, w or h\n\nYou can apply the command by hitting \"Enter\".","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/750394507756587098","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/750394507756587098/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/750394507756587098/thumbnail"}
