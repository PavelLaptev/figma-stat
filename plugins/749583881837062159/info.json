Make a selection\n2. Run the \"Make Component\" function in the plugin\n3. A new Master Component will be created on the components page leaving an instance in place\n\nYou can even create multiple components from a selection all at once if you enable this option.\n\nThis plugin also has a secondary function called \"Collect stray components\". This function will find all master components outside of the dedicated components page, and move them to that page leaving an instance in place.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/749583881837062159","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/749583881837062159/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/749583881837062159/thumbnail"}
