Make sure there's a hashtag at the start of your hex code. \nExamples: #FFFFFF, #000\n\n-> RGB(A)\nBoth rgb and rgba are supported. Make sure your color starts with rgb or rgba. \nExamples: rgb(50%,30%,10%), rgba(123,212,76,0.3)\n\nSee what kind of files you can throw at it, and let me know if something isn't working. If you find any issues, or if you have ideas for extra features you'd like to see, send me a message :)","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/812052673949669543","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/812052673949669543/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/812052673949669543/thumbnail"}
