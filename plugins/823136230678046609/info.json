The plugin iterates through all segments, renders Bezier curves using De Casteljau's algorithm, then reduces the number of points in the lines using Douglas-Peucker algorithm and converts resulting points into new Bezier curves.\n\nThis results in smoother and simpler lines, which can be especially helpful when using Pencil tool.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/823136230678046609","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/823136230678046609/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/823136230678046609/thumbnail"}
