One way to easily create a limited palette, is to select all color styles you want to include, and right click \"Add new folder.\" Name your folder \"~random\" and voila, the plugin will only pull colors from that folder.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: Name is case sensitive! Make sure to write \"~random\" exactly as it is here, with the lowercase \"r\".</p><p><br></p><p>Hot tip: Mac users can bind the plugin to an App Shortcut in System Preferences for quick access to iterate until you find a random combination you like.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1123007826097121484","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1123007826097121484/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1123007826097121484/thumbnail"}
