Each copy is contained within a group that is labelled with the color blindness type. \n\nYou can also choose to only view certain types of color blindness by toggling the checkboxes in the plugin UI.\n\nWe currently don't support converting image layers.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733343906244951586","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733343906244951586/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733343906244951586/thumbnail"}
