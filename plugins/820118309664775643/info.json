Select a component and run this simple plugin to revert it back to a frame in the same way \"Detach Instance\" does with your instances.\n\nIt will also do multiple components if you select more than one.\n\n** What will happen the master has instances? **\n\nAny instances will remain untouched. You will also still be able to run \"Master Component —> Restore Master Component\" on them to restore their master component.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/820118309664775643","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/820118309664775643/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/820118309664775643/thumbnail"}
