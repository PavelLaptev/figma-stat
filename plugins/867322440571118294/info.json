The format will then be: 'TextNode<node-id=node.id>'. This action is reversible.\nThe plugin also lets you export the selected text nodes to your clipboard. If you choose 'Advanced export', you can add any prefix to your node ids. The export action will copy the node ids in an YAML format. It will also add the color, font style, and text decoration to the node.characters. The resulted text will be easily usable in html files. The plugin also formats multiline texts.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/867322440571118294","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/867322440571118294/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/867322440571118294/thumbnail"}
