To create a Stack, select either a single Frame or Component, or two or more layers, and choose ‘Create/Edit Stack’. When you make a change within a Stack, choose ’Update Selected Stacks’ or ‘Update All Stacks’ to update the layout. Pro tip: bind these to a keyboard shortcut to speed up your workflow.\n\nStack parameters:\n* Spacing: The amount of space separating layers.\n* Direction: Whether layers should be stacked horizontally or vertically.\n* Alignment: Whether layers should be aligned to the top, middle or bottom of their parent Frame or Component. This is optional, so layers can maintain their original alignment.\n* Anchoring: The corner to which the parent container resizes relative to.\n\nOther notes:\n* Stacks can be nested inside of other Stacks.\n* Stacks applied to Components also affect their instances. Instances cannot currently be overridden since Figma doesn't support overriding instance child layer positions.\n* Stacks carry over to different pages/documents if the element is copied and pasted to a different \n* Feature requests welcome :)\n\nRoadmap:\n[ ] If Figma adds support for triggering code on events, I’ll add functionality to update Stacks automatically when their contents are changed.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/745754288876102954","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/745754288876102954/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/745754288876102954/thumbnail"}
