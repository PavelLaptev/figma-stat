Find and jump to any Page, Frame, Component, Layer. That's it!\n\nWith the Recents section, you can quickly switch between 2-5 things to which you jumped before. Use arrow keys and return (enter on Win) to move inside the project without lifting your hands from the keyboard.\n\nPro tip: launch plugin with Run last plugin shortcut ⌥ ⌘ P.\n\nI believe you are quite smart to remember the names of layers and pages. So what is the point of losing your mind finding them in the layers panel, right?","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/831936468026040598","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/831936468026040598/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/831936468026040598/thumbnail"}
