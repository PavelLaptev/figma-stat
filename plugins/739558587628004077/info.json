Navigator will look through all of the layers in your document and find the ones with color styles. Simply select the layer that you want to apply a color styles to, run Navigator, find your color and select it. You can apply a color style to any vector, text, line, frame or group.\n\nNote: If you have a large amount of layers in your document, it might take a few seconds longer to load.\n\nYou can use this in conjunction with Chroma or Kaleidocode to create your styles and can keep those frames hidden. Due to limitations with the Figma API, we can only find styles that are on the canvas.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739558587628004077","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739558587628004077/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739558587628004077/thumbnail"}
