This happens because of glyph sidebearings which create huge “white holes”. It gets even worse if you have two text layers of different sizes. In this case the “holes” become much more visible.</p><p><br></p><p>Our plugin compensates for the sidebearings and works with layers in two ways. <em>Strict Alignment</em> moves the text layer to the first visible pixel. It can be useful when you work with a group of single-line text layers. <em>Optically Correct Alignment</em> moves the layer to the sidebearing value of a straight glyph stem (Latin <em>n/u</em>, Cyrillic <em>н</em>). You can use this option for multi-line layers, especially when the text is set in small sizes.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1007645801320386272","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1007645801320386272/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1007645801320386272/thumbnail"}
