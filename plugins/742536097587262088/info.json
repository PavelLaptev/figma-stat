It even works when you have multiple layers selected. \n\nTo use the plugin simply select at least one layer that is nested (either in a frame or group) and then run the plugin. The parent layers of whatever you had selected should now be selected, making it quick and easy to move, make adjustments, etc.\n\nSee a quick demo video here: https://twitter.com/aswellasyouare/status/1163492927559077889","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742536097587262088","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742536097587262088/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742536097587262088/thumbnail"}
