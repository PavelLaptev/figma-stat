You can make it right in your browser via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/console/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify Developer Console</a>.</li><li><strong>Copy the response</strong>&nbsp;(make sure it contains an array of playlists, albums, tracks, artists or categories) and paste it into the plugin.</li><li><strong>Press the button</strong>&nbsp;and wait for a little. Getting covers takes some time. Done!</li></ol><p><br></p><h2><strong>Example</strong></h2><ol><li>Let's pretend your project needs some playlists. You go to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-featured-playlists\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Featured Playlists endpoint</a>&nbsp;and fill in the needed options.</li><li>Then you have to get a token. Spotify will ask you to authorize. Simply, just press green buttons, and it's done.</li><li>Press \"Try it\", then select and copy the API response from the right side.</li><li>Now open the plugin and just paste it. Press \"Get data\" and there you go!</li></ol><p><br></p><h2>Good to know</h2><p>If you close the plugin while it's working, it will stop without filling in the remaining data. When the job is done, the plugin will close automatically.</p><p><br></p><p>This plugin was designed to work with arrays of data (several albums, playlist tracks), so it may behave unpredictably with some endpoints like \"Get an Album\".</p><p><br></p><h2>Roadmap</h2><p><em>This plugin was created for specific needs and its development is dependent on the demand.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Please, suggest the needed features. I guess the next steps could be:</p><ul><li><s>Going to GitHub as an open-source project</s> âœ”</li><li>Expanding the list of supported endpoints</li><li>Way to customize receiving data</li><li>Way to call endpoints right from the plugin</li></ul><h2><br></h2><p>If you're interested in this plugin and want to make it better (features, refactoring), contact me.</p><p><br></p><h2>Problem?
