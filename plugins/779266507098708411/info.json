Divide nesting levels through the \"/\" symbol. Apply style to the element through the plugin.  \n\nExample:\n\"Desktop / Headers / H1 / Black-Bold\n\"Desktop / Headers / H1 / Black-Regular\n\"Desktop / Headers / H2 / Black-Bold\n\"Desktop / Headers / Special\n... \n \nThe plugin will display text styles in a convenient multi-level drop-down navigation.  \n\nFeatures\n— Potentially nesting levels can be infinite. But for convenience, try to limit yourself to 3 or 4 levels. \n\n— Do not use spaces in style names. The plugin will remove them. Instead of spaces, put \"-\" or \"_\" as real front-enders. \n\n— Sort the order of styles through the standard figma interface.\n\n— The plugin is case-sensitive. The \"Headers\" and \"headers\" levels will be separated.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/779266507098708411","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/779266507098708411/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/779266507098708411/thumbnail"}
