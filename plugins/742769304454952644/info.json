Simple right-click on your frame, go to Plugins, Status, and select your desired status.\n\nSome tips:\n- You can select multiple frames at once. Each frame will get its own status badge.\n- Use the keyboard shortcut to quickly set a status: hit `cmd /` in Mac and `ctrl /` on Windows, type a Status (e.g. “Done”) and hit return.\n- Status for Figma is not limited to frames. It works with any object you can select.\n- You can optionally automatically group the selected element and status badge, so they can be moved around easily (see the plugin settings)\n\nStatus for Figma is open source.
