Those are color spaces that, unlike RGB, was created to mirror the visual response of the human eye. That makes them very well suited for interpolating colors, and often produces more natural looking and aesthetically pleasing results.\n\nUsage\n\nChromatic Figma -> Fix Gradient\nThis command will take the gradient of the selected shape and add new color stops to create a (in many cases) more aesthetically pleasing one.\n\nChromatic Figma -> Create Color Scale\nThis command will create a customizable scale between the fill colors of two selected shapes (or colors chosen using color pickers in the popup)","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/759433498184507623","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/759433498184507623/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/759433498184507623/thumbnail"}
