The JSON file is suitable for consumption by a build system framework like style-dictionary. \n\nA basic design libarary is available for you to study, as well as an example project that demonstrates end-to-end integration of design tokens. Just click the help link!\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nHow the plugin works:\nFigma stores your text, color, effect, and layout styles as internal style objects. Design Tokenizer will parse everything it can from these objects.\n\nAdditioally, Design Tokenizer can generate tokens for your margin and padding spacers, radii, and border widths as long as you follow certain conventions:\n\nFrame\n- Create a frame and name it “Sizes.”\n- Created rectangles for each custom style.\n\nSpacer Rectangles\n- Name spacers “spacer/name”. \n- The width and height values are tokenized. \n\nCorner Radius Rectangles\n- Name radii “corner-radius/name”.\n- The corner radius value is tokenized. \n\nBorder Width Rectangles\n- Name border widths “border/name”.\n- The stroke width value is tokenized.\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nLimitations:\n- Image-based color styles are not supported.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/767048666042724266","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/767048666042724266/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/767048666042724266/thumbnail"}
