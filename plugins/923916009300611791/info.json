Unlike other plugins that only order frames or other layers by name in the layers panel, this plugin can organize them by name on the canvas. However, the plugin will also arrange layers by name if they all belong to one parent element.</p><p><br></p><h2>How to use</h2><ul><li>Select layers you want to sort. Preferably they should belong to one parent but anything will work. Run the plugin, it will sort your layers.</li><li>You can also select nothing, in this case plugin will automatically find all frames (only frames) on the page and sort them.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>If something is broken or you have feedback, feel free to reach out via <strong>support contact</strong> on the right side of this page.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/923916009300611791","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/923916009300611791/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/923916009300611791/thumbnail"}
