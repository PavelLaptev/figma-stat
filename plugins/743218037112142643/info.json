Backed by the engine that powers Google Translate, you can test your designs in up to 104 different languages.\n\nWorkflow\nSelect one or more text layers and select the language you'd like to translate to. In a moment the text of the selected text layers will be replaced with their translations. You can also select one or more Frames, Components, or Groups to translate all of the text layers within them.\n\nPro Tip\nWith one or more text layers selected, use Figma's menu search command (âŒ˜+/) to quickly open the menu search field, then simply type the language you want to translate to and press return.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/743218037112142643","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/743218037112142643/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/743218037112142643/thumbnail"}
