Select a base size. For desktop, for example, usual practice is somewhere between 14px and 16px.\n2. Select a scaling factor. Major Third seems to create the best hierrarchy for bigger screens.\n3. Check the preview to see if you're happy with the result. You can see the pixel value of the size, as well as the em value relative to the base size (useful for all you devs out there)\n4. Hit \"Generate Layers\" to get text layers with the sizes applied so you don't have to do it manually.\n\nInspiration\n\nThis plugin has been inspired by Jeremy Church's www.type-scale.com","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/741231992144144738","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/741231992144144738/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/741231992144144738/thumbnail"}
