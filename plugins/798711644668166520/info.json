Current version doesn't yet process raster images and mixed text color properties (but you still can have them in your selection).\n\nAdjustments work with any selection including groups and frames, but keep in mind that large selections can impact performance badly.\n\nAny selection change with plugin already running results in resetting the sliders and rebuilding selection color data (careful on large selections).","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/798711644668166520","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/798711644668166520/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/798711644668166520/thumbnail"}
