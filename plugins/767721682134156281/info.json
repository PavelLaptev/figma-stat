There is no reply feature! 🛑</p><p><br></p><p>——————————</p><p><br></p><p>❖ Started a new project in Figma and realized you should've used Components instead of Frames too late? 🤬 Master plugin allows you to create new component from a set of any objects (and save all overrides):</p><p><br></p><p>1. Select any number of similar objects in your Figma file.</p><p>2. Run the Master plugin command “Create Component from Objects”</p><p>3. The new main Component will be created</p><p>4. Selected objects will become its Instances with all possible overrides applied!</p><p><br></p><p>❖ Also Master would help you “attach” objects of any kind to the existing Component, even if it is in another file:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Select one Instance or Component. Run “Pick Target Component” command, the plugin will remember selected Component.</p><p>2. Select Instances or other objects you want to turn into Instances of the saved Component.</p><p>3. Run the command called “Link Objects to Target Component”.</p><p>4. All objects will be replaced with Instances of the previously selected Component, keeping overrides where possible.</p><p><br></p><p>——————————</p><p><br></p><h2>❖ When to use Master plugin</h2><p>• When you have created several copies of one Frame or Group for exploration and need to turn them into one Component.</p><p>• When realize you should have used Instances of one Component instead of regular objects too late.</p><p>• If you want to create a new master Component for a bunch of existing Instances (clone component).</p><p>• To create different versions of one component for different layouts or screen sizes.</p><p>• You want to create a local copy of a Component, Instances of which were imported from Team Library.</p><p>• If you need to quickly get the ability to manipulate multiple similar objects at once.</p><p>• Create new Master Component and put it to the side while keeping the Instance in place.</p><p>• If you create art with repeating parts and want change them all at once.</p><p>• When you want to “Smart Animate” one Component into another one.</p><p>• Your Instance was detached from Master Component when copying to another file? Reattach it with Master plugin.</p><p>• When you want to copy components to another file and they get detached.</p><p>• To avoid fixing issues with the components imported from Sketch manually.</p><p>• You used Blend plugin on an object and want to change all the copies at once.</p><p><br></p><p>——————————</p><p><br></p><h2>❖ Technical info</h2><p>• Selection can include Frames, Groups and Instances of other components. All of them should have similar sets of elements in them. Objects which have different structures will be ignored. Alternatively you can select a bunch of layers of the same type, like texts, ellipses or rectangles.</p><p>• Note that prototyping connections will be removed from processed objects because of the Figma Plugin API limitations.</p><p><br></p><p>——————————</p><p><br></p><h2>❖ About license</h2><p>Your license purchase means a lot to me as an indie developer! With the license purchase you will be able to use the plugin as much as you want, while free trial version is limited to five successful uses per file. There is&nbsp;<strong>no subscription</strong>, no cost of updates, no hidden fees!</p><p><br></p><p>Please don't share your license code with anyone.
