It then automatically deduces the dominant direction and alignment to apply <strong>auto-layout </strong>accordingly. The algorithm automatically runs this process <strong>recursively</strong> until the design and all its children containers become <strong>responsive</strong>. As a result, you can <strong>resize</strong> the design and see how it responds smartly to growing and shrinking content.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To tweak the results, you can undo (Cmd+Z) all changes and make smaller layers responsive rather than fixing the whole design at once.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/949920030355361745","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/949920030355361745/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/949920030355361745/thumbnail"}
