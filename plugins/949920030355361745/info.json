It then automatically deduces the dominant direction and alignment to apply <strong>auto-layout </strong>accordingly. The algorithm automatically runs this process <strong>recursively</strong> until the design and all its children containers become <strong>responsive</strong>. As a result, you can <strong>resize</strong> the design and see how it responds smartly to growing and shrinking content.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To tweak the results, you can undo (Cmd+Z) all changes and make smaller layers responsive rather than fixing the whole design at once.</p><p><br></p><p>Resources:</p><ul><li>Tutorial file: <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/exit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Fauto-responsive-figma\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/auto-responsive-figma</a> </li><li>Video demo: <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/exit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Fauto-responsive-demo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/auto-responsive-demo</a></li></ul>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/949920030355361745","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/949920030355361745/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/949920030355361745/thumbnail"}
