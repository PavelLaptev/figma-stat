Compose your image within the Image object of each Frame. Frames can be rearranged, added, and deleted as you’d like.</li><li>When you’re done composing, select your Filmstrip and use the “Create Storyboard from Filmstrip” menu item to generate a formatted Storyboard.</li><li>Iterate on the Filmstrip and regenerate Storyboards as you’d like!</li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>ADDITIONAL FEATURES / NOTES:</strong></p><ol><li>From the menu, you can create an additional Frame of common film aspect ratios. You can drag these into your filmstrip and duplicate to change your Storyboard’s aspect ratio, or mix &amp; match.</li><li>By default, the plugin will automatically number your frames in the order they appear in the Filmstrip. You can override these numbers by unlocking the “#.” text object and editing the text to whatever label you’d like.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>See an example at this <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1060667335687534014\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">demo file</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>I made this to enable a personal workflow for making and laying out storyboards in Figma. Maybe someone else will find it useful too! :) </p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1061447066515075814","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1061447066515075814/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1061447066515075814/thumbnail"}
