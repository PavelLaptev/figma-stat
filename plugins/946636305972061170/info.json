In print there is a baseline that text sit on. On the web it sits in the middle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What can I do here?</h2><p>This plugin lets you generate a modular scale and a line-height to make sure everything fits on a grid using Auto-Layout. You can also put in a margin component to give spacing where it is needed. These margin components and the line-height of each text generated creates consistent vertical spacing that fits on the grid.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Set a base-size</p><p>2. Set a multiplier</p><p>3. Set a line-height</p><p>4. Choose to generate styles or not (give the folder a name to stay organized!)</p><p>5. Choose to use Margins or not (all generated have a default margin using the line-height)</p><p>6. Write some text to use your headings and paragraphs. There is an example using ATX headings in the markdown. To write ATX headings make sure there is a newline to write new stuff. I would advise writing the ATX headings elsewhere and copy and pasting it in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7. Ideas?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>It would be great to build out a real markdown parser.
