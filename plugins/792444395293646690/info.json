You can then apply the new color to fills and/or strokes and select between different object types.\n\nThis is the missing color switcher feature for your next project and can help you speed up your design process.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/792444395293646690","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/792444395293646690/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/792444395293646690/thumbnail"}
