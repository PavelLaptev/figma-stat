It uses a probabilistic supervised classifier and an integer programming solver to suggest links for your prototype based on the frames' text content and color composition. As a result of its research status, errors can occur and unexpected results are common.</p><p><br></p><p>-----</p><p><br></p><p>&gt; Note: This Figma plugin is part of a master thesis project titled \"Assignment-Based Link Optimization in GUI Prototyping Using Incremental Supervised Classification\" by Christoph A.
