Overlapping paths will be simplified so only the outer shape is defined. The flattening happens in-place.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>Usage</h2><ol><li>Select some layers</li><li>Run the plugin by going to&nbsp;<code>Plugins &gt; Really Flatten Vectors</code>&nbsp;or pressing&nbsp;<code>⌘/</code>&nbsp;and searching for&nbsp;<code>Really Flatten Vectors</code>.</li></ol><p><br></p><h2><strong>Links</strong></h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/stevenla/figma-plugin-really-flatten-vector\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://steven.la/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Personal Site</a></li></ul><p><br></p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>Generally, Figma simplifies paths when using the built-in flatten&nbsp;<code>⌘E</code>&nbsp;on a union layer. This plugin simplifies the setup needed to get a pretty flattened output.</p><ol><li>Deeply ungroup/unframe the selection. This keeps positioning simple for some of the later operations.</li><li>Outline all strokes. Since this plugin merges everything into one path, strokes cannot be preserved. All strokes and text are outlined.</li><li>Use the first valid fill paint data to use as the output fill.</li><li>Use Figma's built-in flatten to merge the layers. Figma is pretty intelligent and will place the resulting layer in the correct spot in the layer hierarchy.</li><li>Create a union layer that contains the resulting layer from the previous step, and a clone of that same layer. This is because running the built-in flatten on a union with just one layer won't simplify the paths. If there is an exact replica inside the union, then the resulting layer will have simplified paths.</li><li>Run the built-in flatten against the union.</li></ol><h2><br></h2>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1099596352042014853","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1099596352042014853/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1099596352042014853/thumbnail"}
