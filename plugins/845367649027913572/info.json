A few highlights:</p><p><br></p><p>- Supports constraints and auto-layout.</p><p>- Translates blend modes.</p><p>- Adapts border styles including centered borders.</p><p>- Handles filter effects like background blur and layer blur.</p><p>- Preserves affine transformations like scales and rotations.</p><p>- Handles all fill types including linear and radial gradients and images.</p><p>- Imports vector and compound shapes as SVGs.</p><p>- Mirrors the original hierarchical structure.</p><p>- Carries over most type styles.</p><p><br></p><p>After importing, you will often want to do more work to make it production-ready. That’s where the rest of Plasmic’s toolset comes in, letting you set production-grade layout, swap in accessible functional components, add interactions, and much more. Finally, you can easily deploy into production or integrate into any existing codebase.</p><p><br></p><p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/plasmicapp\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/plasmicapp</a> for the latest updates.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/845367649027913572","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/845367649027913572/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/845367649027913572/thumbnail"}
