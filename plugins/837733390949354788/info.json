Figma doesn't support registering sidebar shortcuts in instances yet, but the plugin still works from the menu.</p><p><br></p><p>• Can I run it via a keyboard shortcut?</p><p>For many workflows, relying on Figma's native ⌘＋⌥＋P (Run Last Plugin) should speed things up enough. The plugin's commands don't distinguish between creation and update exactly so that the only shortcut we have is as smart as it can be. If you still want to register them permanently on your Mac, you can create custom shortcuts in macOS: <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2271/mac\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2271/mac</a></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/837733390949354788","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/837733390949354788/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/837733390949354788/thumbnail"}
