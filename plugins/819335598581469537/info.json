Alternatively you can set an exact rotation in degrees on the right. You can also modify the rotation of the model itself there.</li><li>Choose a device color. If you have local color styles click the color swatch to choose one, or manually enter a hex code.</li><li>Click \"Save as Image\" to render the current view as an image layer in Figma.</li><li>To edit the mockup after it's been saved, select the layer and click \"Edit Mockup\" under Plugin on the properties panel.
