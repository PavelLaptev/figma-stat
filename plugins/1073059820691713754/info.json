Write Markdown-styled documentation and save it directly to your components.</p><p><br></p><h2>Editing</h2><p>Select a Frame or Component and open the editor to write your documentation. Use <a href=\"https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Markdown</a> to style your documentation by adding: headers, lists, images, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2>Viewing</h2><p>View your documentation by selecting anything with saved documentation.</p><p><br></p><h2>FAQ</h2><p><strong>Is there a license or a fee?</strong></p><p>No. Gist was made for any design team - regardless of their ability to pay. If you or your team would like to donate you can do that here: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/mikewilson\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">ko-fi.com/mikewilson</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Can I add images/gifs?</strong></p><p>Yes - for now use the markdown syntax of <code>![caption](link)</code>. <a href=\"https://gyazo.com/en\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Gyazo </a>has a nice 'copy markdown' feature. I will be adding images to the insert dropdown soon!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where is my data stored?</strong></p><p>The data is stored on a hidden layer on the component you save to. This means your data stays in your Figma.</p><p><br></p><p>There are plans to add the ability to sync your docs to Github, but that will be optional and turned off by default.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is there a max doc size?</strong></p><p>No - but its best to keep them concise for the sake of your designers and your file. Since docs are saved to the component, adding a *ton* of content can slow down a file.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Can/should I add docs to small components?</strong></p><p>Keep docs very short on or avoid adding them to smaller components that may appear hundreds of times in larger components and throughout a file e.g. an individual icon.</p><p><br></p><p>If you need to document these components I recommend adding a component-specific documentation frame that a designer could grab from the asset panel.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1073059820691713754","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1073059820691713754/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1073059820691713754/thumbnail"}
