As soon as you enter a number in the text field or use the slider, the button will change to the color of your currently selected hue.</p><p><br></p><p>If you select some layers in your file that have any Solid or Gradient fills, and hit the Apply button, it will change all of the hue values of the colors in those layers to the hue you have selected in the plugin. The saturation, lightness, and opacity of your layers will all remain the same.</p><p><br></p><h1>Found a bug or have an idea?</h1><p>This is a team of&nbsp;one, but if you have any good ideas or constructive feedback, please do not hesitate to share your thoughts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/cross-team/figma-hues/issues/new\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">by creating a new issue</a>&nbsp;- screen captures are welcomed.</p><p><br></p><h1>Show your support</h1><p>If you find this plugin useful, feel free to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/mpaiva\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">buy me a&nbsp;üç∫</a>&nbsp;at my Patreon page.
