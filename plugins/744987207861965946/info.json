Said no one ever. \n\nStunt & flex with these drop shadows instead, or tweak them to your liking. \nJust select a layer, pick a shadow size and your next Dribbble post will be a guaranteed success.\n\nTired of your clients/PO wanting your designs to \"pop\" a bit?\n\nSay no more fam. Shadow picker got your back. You can easily inherit the current background color to your shadow to get a smooth blend.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/744987207861965946","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/744987207861965946/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/744987207861965946/thumbnail"}
