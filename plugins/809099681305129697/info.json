In some cases, we have 15px spacing, and in another place, 14px. It's hard always to update all these spacings manually.</p><p><br></p><p>With the help of auto layout, we can resolve this problem. Just turn on the auto layout feature with zero spacing between the elements and use \"spacers\" between.</p><p><br></p><p>There are different ways, but I prefer to use the 8-Point Grid System. You can use premade \"spacers\" from the public library (<a href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/file/809152234949654615/Spacings\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.figma.com/c/file/809152234949654615/Spacings</a>) and place them between the elements. In that case, you will make sure that the spacings between the components are consistent.</p><p><br></p><p>How it works</p><p>Add the library <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/file/809152234949654615/Spacings\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.figma.com/c/file/809152234949654615/Spacings</a> or have own symbols that have \"$spacing\" word in the name;</p><p>Use them when needed</p><p>If you want to hide them, select a parent frame and run the plugin. It will look for all spacers that were used on the frame and will set zero opacity</p><p>If you want to show spacers back, just rerun the plugin. If the first spacer on the row will have zero opacity, it will set 100% for all spacers found on the selected frame.</p><p><br></p><p>Pro tip</p><p>You can use smart spacing prediction feature!
