Then click \"Copy Selected Layers\". After the operation completes, simply paste the selected layers from your clipboard using the menu or keyboard shortcut.\n\nImporting from Figma into Origami supports custom shapes, frames, text, images, and masks. Since Origami doesn't support multiple fills, strokes, or shadows, only the first of each will be copied.\n\nFor questions and support, please visit the Origami Community Group on Facebook.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/832268423801619787","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/832268423801619787/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/832268423801619787/thumbnail"}
