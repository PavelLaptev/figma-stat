Copy the text from your mockups with ease. Fast Copy can help you copy-paste multiple text nodes by organizing everything into a table and automatically copying the text into your clipboard.\n\n1. Select a group or frame.\n2. Run the Fast Copy plugin.\n3. Click on the text that you want to copy. \n\nDon't worry about pressing ⌘-C or Ctrl-C because we'll automatically add it to your clipboard.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nNext feature that I'm thinking about is to allow you to copy the whole table or the whole column instead of individual cells.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/799361006626561487","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/799361006626561487/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/799361006626561487/thumbnail"}
