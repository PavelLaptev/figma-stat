No exports, copying and pasting files, no code cleaning or additional optimizations. \n\nFor developers: Imagine that you receive a bunch of icons from your fellow designer. You have to extract needed data from all those SVG files... It's time consuming... Forget about it. Now you can easily export all icons data to a JSON file with one click! If you have a custom Icon component in React, Angular or Vue â€” that's all you need.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Create frames / components / instances with unique names (plugin seeks for every frame / components / instances in a current page)\n2. Draw icons or paste them from your favorite tool (like IconJar)\n3. Flatten them (if they are not already)\n4. Use the plugin to create a JSON with needed data\n5. Use data with your custom Icon component\n6. ðŸŽ‰\n\nTip! Hidden frames, components or instances are skipped by the plugin\n\n=========================\nCustom components & examples:\n1. React â€” https://codesandbox.io/s/react-icon-component-3giqg\n2. Angular (by @foull) â€” https://codesandbox.io/s/angular-icon-component-pg7py\n3. Vue â€” https://codesandbox.io/s/vue-icon-component-neclt\n4. Svelte â€” https://codesandbox.io/s/svelte-icon-component-5qyr3\n=========================\n\nIcon data model:\n{\n  name: string;\n  paths: { windingRule: string, data: string }[];\n  size: {\n    width: number;\n    height: number;\n  };\n  fill: {\n    rgb: string;\n    hsl: string;\n    hex: string;\n  };\n  translate: {\n    x: number;\n    y: number;\n  };\n  viewBox: string;\n}","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/741549820671978943","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/741549820671978943/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/741549820671978943/thumbnail"}
