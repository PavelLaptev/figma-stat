This bug should be fixed soon.\n\nAbout the Create Guides window:\n⚠ To get into it, you need to click on the name of the frame.\n\n1. The Margin parameter is specified in the following order: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left.\n\n2. Some parameters support the \"auto\" value. \n\nIt can be used, for example, to center the columns by setting the margin-left and margin-right parameters to \"auto\".\nIf you specify it only for margin-left, and margin-right set to 0, then the columns will be pressed to the right edge.\n\n⚠ When applying the template, - if its parameters are not suitable for the selected frame, - they will be adjusted.\n\nFor example, if the template contains 10 columns with a width of 100px, and the frame has a width of only 500px, then the number of columns will be reduced to 5.\n\n___\nA demo video with an example of usage can be found here: producthunt.com/posts/guides-inspector-figma-plugin","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/763500131554051614","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/763500131554051614/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/763500131554051614/thumbnail"}
