Your clients, and yourself, deserve better content.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether you are designing an app or a website, UI Copy will help you come up with better copy for your layout‘s content.</p><p><br></p><p>The plugin is not AI-based. We used our wordsmithing intelligence to analyze thousands of conversion-oriented websites and built a repository of words and phrases that you can apply in your marketing copy. No AI tool can do that.</p><p><br></p><p>UI Copy emphasizes two key features:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Voice and Tone</strong>. Helps you sound either casual and witty or as a soulless corporate suit. As you might‘ve guessed, we prefer the former, but we are still being objective and balance the repository with 50/50 of each.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Smart Variables</strong>. We used the syntactic constructions of the English language to predict where things stay stable in a sentence and sprinkle in variables to assemble phrases for your specific need.</p><p><br></p><p>Give it a try.
