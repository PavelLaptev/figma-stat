While this plugin is activated, the Bezier curves' curvature of the selected vector is shown. Adjust the handles of the Bezier curves to smoothen: If the curvature of both Bezier curves is equal, there will be no sharp edges.</p><p><br></p><p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://en.99designs.de/blog/engineering/math-draw-vector-curves/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.99designs.de/blog/engineering/math-draw-vector-curves/</a></p><p>Please reach out to me for any improvements you have in mind.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/932729267119671976","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/932729267119671976/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/932729267119671976/thumbnail"}
