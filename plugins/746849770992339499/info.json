On the other hand, unused components clutter up your document.\n\nSafely Delete Components does two things:\n\nðŸ—‘  Safe Delete\n\n1. Select a component you want to delete\n2. Go to Plugins > Safely Delete Components > Safe Delete (or âŒ˜+/ > \"Safe Delete\")\n3. This component will be deleted if there are no instances of it in the document\n\nðŸ§¹  Delete Unused Components\n\n1. Go to Plugins > Safely Delete Components > Delete Unused Components (or âŒ˜+/ > \"Delete Unused Components\")\n2. The plugin will find components with no instances and delete them\n\nWhen the plugin finishes its work, you'll see which components have been deleted.\n\nBe aware that this plugin can be very slow with large documents, especially when working with unused components.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/746849770992339499","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/746849770992339499/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/746849770992339499/thumbnail"}
