This plugin aims to let you define your variables to keep design tokens consistent in your file across time.</strong></h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>It complements the existing design variables that Figma manages already well. This is why you will find every property but colors, text styles, effects, and strokes.</strong></h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>I use it for both local variables like table columns width and global variables like the spacing between my cards.</strong></h3><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>I hope this plugin will help you in your daily job!</strong></h3>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/921872998294164297","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/921872998294164297/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/921872998294164297/thumbnail"}
