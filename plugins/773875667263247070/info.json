Launch the plugin and click on the launch icon (top, right).\n2. Indicate the size of the grid.\n3. Done! By dragging the canvas elements you will notice that they snap to the cells.\n\nâš  To work, the plugin must be running!\n\nI recommend working with the grid enabled so that the result is clearer.\n\nDemonstration: twitter.com/AndreslavKozlov/status/1198003232137764864","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/773875667263247070","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/773875667263247070/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/773875667263247070/thumbnail"}
