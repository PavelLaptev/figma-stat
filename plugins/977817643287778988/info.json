It allows you to capture designs as PNG files that sync. We call these ‘Mirrors’. Jump instantly from Mirror to source for quick editing. Keep everything up-to-date with one-click sync.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why did we create MockupMirror?</strong></h2><p>Complicated user experience flows and information architecture maps require designers to reproduce numerous identical versions of the same designs. Scattered instances are hard to manage and can fall out of sync with the original design. Mockup Mirror simplifies the design process by capturing PNG images of your designs to paste into flows anywhere in the file. Use hyperlinks to jump from image to source for quick editing. Sync changes with one click.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/977817643287778988","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/977817643287778988/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/977817643287778988/thumbnail"}
