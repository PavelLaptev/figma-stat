You won't be able to update Remote Text Styles as Local Styles would be created instead. To update library styles perform all changes in library files.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/759472336242530542","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/759472336242530542/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/759472336242530542/thumbnail"}
