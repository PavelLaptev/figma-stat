Where show/hide removes the spacers entirely, opacity retains the layout, letting designers and developers show and hide spacer colors/labels as needed.</p><p><br></p><p>This plugin will only affect instances of component sets with \"~spacer\" included in the name. You must also create a variant property named \"Visible\" with \"On\" and \"Off\" values. Set \"On\" to 100% opacity and \"Off\" to 0% opacity.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: Names are case sensitive!</p><p><br></p><p>Hot tip: Mac users can bind the plugin to an App Shortcut in System Preferences for quick access. I like to use control + F (as it's right next to the grid shortcut).</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1119123732088744027","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1119123732088744027/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1119123732088744027/thumbnail"}
