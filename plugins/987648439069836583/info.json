Right now Figma pastes retina images at their full pixel dimensions. If (like me) you find yourself scaling these by 50% an awful lot, a keyboard shortcut is a rather handy thing. Ideally the plugin would be called \"Paste and scale\" but triggering a system paste in a Figma plugin seems tricky or a no-go – contributions welcome!</p><p><br></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/987648439069836583","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/987648439069836583/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/987648439069836583/thumbnail"}
