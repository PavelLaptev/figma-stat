The browser and OS navigation bars add a dynamic offset to the final viewport. The danger zone represent the average difference in height between screen resolution and viewport.\n\n*They are equal only when the web browser is in fullscreen mode\n\n🐛Where can I report bugs or suggest features?\n\nOur Spectrum community is always open to your ideas:\n\nhttps://spectrum.chat/visualeyes-designers/above-the-fold?tab=posts","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/844939343179979517","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/844939343179979517/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/844939343179979517/thumbnail"}
