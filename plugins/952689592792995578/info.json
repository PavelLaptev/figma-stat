You are Albus Dumbledore and you need to generate acceptance letters for the new batch at Hogwarts. The new batch has 40 students and Professor McGonagall has already handed off the letter to you on Figma.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, you are definitely not going to change the name and export the letter 40 times. That's too brutal. That's too naïve.</p><p>Let Scribe cast its magic.</p><p>===</p><p><br></p><p>And with this new and upgraded version – <strong>Scribe is more powerful than ever.</strong></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Here's what Scribe can do:</strong></h2><p>💿 Import data from a CSV or a Google Sheet</p><p>🎞 Generate from multiple frames in one go</p><p>🔒 No more publicly published Google Sheets. Scribe Bot can now be added to your Sheet and Drive as a collaborator</p><p>💬 Replace the content of Text Layers</p><p>🗯 Partially replace the content of Text Layers</p><p>📸 Replace fill of Frame Layer with images</p><p>⚡️ Transform layers with Customisations</p><p>☁️ Special integration with Google Drive to make managing images painless</p><p>📦 Customise your exports</p><p>🏎 Under the hood, Scribe is rewritten from scratch with performance at the centre stage. On my machine (MacBook Pro 2020, M1), It generated 1000 frames with Text Layers in about 724 seconds. That's 0.72 seconds per frame. That's ffaasstt!</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>How to use:</strong></h2><p><strong>✏️ Name the layers</strong></p><p>The layer names of text layers must begin with a <code>#</code> followed by the field name of the Data Source column that they'd be substituted by.</p><p>For example: For a Data Source containing names of people in the column <code>name</code> , the name of the text layer in Figma would be <code>#name</code>. <em>Naming is case-sensitive.</em></p><p>There are plenty more customisations available in the documentation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>🏃‍♀️ Run Scribe</strong></p><p>Select your frame and run Scribe.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>📀 Import data</strong></p><p>You can import the data from a CSV file or a Google Sheet.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>⚙️ Configure and scribe</strong></p><p>Tweak some settings to make the setup really personal. Finally, scribe and have your graphics handcrafted and exported to you in mere seconds.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Why Scribe?</strong></h2><p>There's so much Scribe can do.</p><p>- Generate certificates for the awesome attendees of your conference</p><p>- Perform a batch generation of coupons</p><p>- Create personalised gratitude-full letters for all your small-business supporters</p><p><br></p><p>Give Scribe a try if you want to:</p><p>- Create beautiful data-driven graphics in a fraction of the time it takes to do by hand</p><p>- Automate the process of creating a bunch of graphics with real data</p><p><br></p><p>There's a Kitchen Sink available here to showcase the power of Scribe:&nbsp;</p><p>👾 https://youtu.be/EOWnPWuPNPI</p><p><br></p><p>And here's the entire documentation:</p><p>📝 https://docs.scribe.ishanchhabra.com</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/952689592792995578","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/952689592792995578/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/952689592792995578/thumbnail"}
