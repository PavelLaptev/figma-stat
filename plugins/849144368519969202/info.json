Paletteer lets you generate a more versatile set of color shades from your key brand colors. Simply select a set of objects and trigger Paletteer to generate swatches and save your new color palette to your local styles.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/849144368519969202","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/849144368519969202/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/849144368519969202/thumbnail"}
