I know, I know, you have to duplicate your work if you already have a design. But the extra work is to guarantee the best output possible!</p><p><br></p><p>Why? Well, it's the most reliable way to understand what you are designing: is it a navigation bar, or a button, or an input? By using the built in components you are telling us what to convert them to 🙂</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>How to get started?</strong></h2><ol><li>Install the Plugin</li><li>Select the components you want to use</li><li>Customize at your own will</li><li>Click \"Preview\" to open it in the browser (<strong>you have to create a Makers account</strong>*)</li><li>Whenever you are ready: Publish it 🚀</li></ol><p><br></p><h2><strong>Why do I have to create an account?</strong></h2><p>To save your sites securely. When you Preview a design within the Makers Plugin you are already creating a website that you can share with your friends, colleagues or mom 😍</p><p><br></p><p>The most secure way to know the site is yours is by associating it with an account. You get this, right?</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>What you can easily build:</strong></h2><ul><li>Landing Pages</li><li>Portfolio / Personal sites</li><li>Blogging</li><li>Careers / Wiki sites</li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>Templates:</strong></h2><p>Templates are the best way to <a href=\"https://makers.so/templates\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">get started with makers</a>.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Tutorials:</strong></h2><p>Here are the official resources of <a href=\"https://makers.so/tutorials\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">how to make and publish sites with Figma</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>—</p><p><br></p><p>If you read thus far, thank you! I really hope this Plugin can help you make your life easier 😎</p><p><br></p><p>Create something insanely great 🙌</p><p>I can’t wait to see what you create with Makers!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Why I build Makers:</strong></h2><p>As a front-end developer I've converted hundreds of Figma designs into code. My clients are usually busy startups or web agencies wanted to speed up their workflow.</p><p><br></p><p>However the ability to automatically publish Figma designs into a custom domain (without going to an engineer and \"design to code\") is something that would benefit all the community. Specially for simple projects.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Questions:</strong></h2><p>Feel free to comment in this page or drop me an email at <a href=\"mailto:support@makers.so\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">support@makers.so</a></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/991438050654881175","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/991438050654881175/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/991438050654881175/thumbnail"}
