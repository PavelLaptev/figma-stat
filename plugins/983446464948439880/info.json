Optionally place something that looks like a goal post somewhere. Players will spawn at the bottom-left of the frame. Collision detection is done <strong>only</strong> between rectangles, so only non-rotated rectangles are supported and every other layer is ignored. Also overlapping rectangles can cause weirdnesses right now so try to have them not overlap if possible. You can name a layer \"bg\" to have collision detection ignore it (for custom art). When you're done, select your Frame and run this Plugin to race!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><p>This is a simple plugin that takes in user input and does some simple platforming calculations to move a node around. The viewport then follows that node. The magic lies in Figma's multiplayer, which lets <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/coming-together-at-config-2021/#_500-users\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">up to 100 users</a> run this plugin simultaneously to edit nodes on the same page. There is no countdown timer to start the race, no finish line detection, no concept of lives or death.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/983446464948439880","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/983446464948439880/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/983446464948439880/thumbnail"}
