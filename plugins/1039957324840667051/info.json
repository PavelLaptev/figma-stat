This means that you can spend less time typing out your feedback, and more time capturing ideas right as inspiration strikes.</p><p><br></p><p>To leave live feedback in FigJam, simply record your comments in the file of choice, then watch your video preview unfurl alongside your work. When working on a project in Figma Design, you can embed your video as a thumbnail directly on the Figma canvas. Your collaborators can then watch your comments, ideas, or accolades via simple playback within your whiteboard or canvas.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here’s how your team can use Vimeo Record to work better together:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Project onboarding</strong>: Record a short welcome video to review goals, progress, and next steps so new team members can get up to speed quickly without the need for another meeting or lengthy email.</li><li><strong>Design feedback</strong>: Highlight specific visual elements while narrating your feedback to keep your ideas in context.</li><li><strong>Async ideation</strong>: Share your ideas at the moment inspiration strikes to add more engaging context to your projects -- then let your team watch and respond with comments when it’s convenient for them.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>How to get started:</strong></p><ol><li>Download the Vimeo Record plugin</li><li>Connect Vimeo to your Figma account</li><li>Select recording modes</li><li>Create your video</li><li>Add video to canvas or share link to it with your team</li><li><a href=\"https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415753338509\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Check this How-to article for more details</a></li><li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/record?utm_campaign=screen_recorder&amp;utm_content=figma_community_page_cta&amp;vcid=\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Install Vimeo Record Chrome Extension to record videos wherever you go</a></li></ol>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1039957324840667051","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1039957324840667051/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1039957324840667051/thumbnail"}
