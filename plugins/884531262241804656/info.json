I also had the idea of developing a plugin since I learned a bit of Vue and JS during the pandemic then looking at current tools I realized that there is not a tool that you can just drag and drop something to the area you want.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I've discovered that Figma has a very open and collaborative developer space, using all of these free resources and building on top of them, I've built my first plugin. I'm so happy to share it with you ❤️!</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Resources &amp; Inspirations:</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>BIG THANKS! to <a href=\"https://github.com/jackiecorn/figma-plugin-drag-and-drop\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>jackiecorn</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <a href=\"https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figma-plugins-on-github\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>thomas-lowry</strong></a><strong> </strong>wi</p><p>hout their starter GitHub repos I couldn't be able to put such features together.</p><p><br></p><p>Drag &amp; Drop Starter Template:</p><p><a href=\"http:// https://github.com/jackiecorn/figma-plugin-drag-and-drop\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> https://github.com/jackiecorn/figma-plugin-drag-and-drop</a></p><p><br></p><p>Figma Plugin Webpack Sample:</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples/tree/master/webpack\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples/tree/master/webpack</a></p><p><br></p><p>Icons:</p><p><a href=\"https://feathericons.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://feathericons.com/</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Send Your SVGs and Feedback!</strong></h2><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvEpjqXvmbMNEjRkHle70pi7fDhnirWiLojEEWt9tDBbl3uQ/viewform?usp=sf_link\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Send me your SVGs</a> so I can include them on the next relase, you can also <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvEpjqXvmbMNEjRkHle70pi7fDhnirWiLojEEWt9tDBbl3uQ/viewform?usp=sf_link\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">share any feedback</a>.
