It all happens within Figma's Quick Action bar. This is useful for editing multiple layers in one go, especially if they are deeply nested within component instances.</p><p><br></p><p>You also get a neat list of automatic suggestions consisting of ...</p><ul><li>up to three <strong>recently used queries</strong> and</li><li>most <strong>frequently found layer names</strong> in your <strong>current selection</strong>, filtered live by your query.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The little number in front of the suggestions shows how many layers match this query. The selection you end up with might differ from that number, because the preview counts both, matching parent layers and matching children layers. Your selection will only contain the matching parent layer in such cases.</p><p><br></p><h2>Commands</h2><ul><li><strong>Select: </strong>Select layers with the help of an index of all layer names in the selection (or page).</li><li><strong>Select ‚è≠: </strong>Skip creating the index. Useful if working with huge sets of layers, where creating the layer name index can get slow.</li><li><strong>Subtract: </strong>Remove layers from the selection. Only affects the parent layers in the selection, not the children.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Modes</h2><ul><li><strong>Default</strong>: Select all layers that contain your query. Position within the name and case doesn't matter.</li><li><strong>\"Complete and precise\": </strong>Select only layers with exactly the name you select. This is case sensitive and white space also matters. Quotes mark these type of queries, no need to type the quotes, though.</li><li><strong>/Regular expression/: </strong>Select layers that match the regular expression that you enter as a parameter. Slashes mark these type of queries, no need to type them. Regular expressions show up as a suggestion when you use expressions like [0-9] or ^ in your query.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The plugin is inspired by <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/799648692768237063/Select-Layers\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">Select Layers</a> by Yuan Qing Lim, I've been an avid user of the \"Select layers by name\" function and saw an opportunity to make that workflow in particular a bit quicker and more powerful using the new parameters API and regular expressions.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1040373257649266080","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1040373257649266080/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1040373257649266080/thumbnail"}
