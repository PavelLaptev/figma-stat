This makes adding a collection of notes faster from your favourite text editor and/or spreadsheet.\n\nYou can also replace text of an existing note by pasting text when you have that note selected. This also works for inserting multiple notes of a specific colour.\n\n---------------\nChange colours\n---------------\nChange the colour of an existing note to another one in the palette by using the \"Change colour\" command","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/776702826923617343","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/776702826923617343/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/776702826923617343/thumbnail"}
