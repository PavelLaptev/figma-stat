No longer fill your designs with lorem ipsum or irrelevant names, objects, places and more.\n\nHow to use: \n1. Write your JSON as one big object containing arrays with a key as name. Example can be seen in the screenshot or on the git repo. \n2. Enter the url in the plugin and press save\n3. Select one or more text layers and press one of the buttons generated based on your JSON to replace the text layer(s).\n\nExtra:\nHost your JSON on some repo so it's easily maintanable. You could also use a free service such as 'myjson.com'. Your URL should be saved on this instance of Figma. However keep a backup of the url just in case you switch to a different computer or between browser/desktop often. \n\nRoadmap:\n- Better error handling\n- Support more JSON structures\n- Use local JSON/paste JSON","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/749195619095691211","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/749195619095691211/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/749195619095691211/thumbnail"}
