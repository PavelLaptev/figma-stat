It'll help you create and store multiple versions of a design without the error-prone copying and pasting OR detatching instances when you need to change one keyword or layer.</p><p><br></p><p>Using FigSheets is simple:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Create a sheet; specify the number of layers, keywords, or entire blocks of content you want to swap out of a template.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Add your Master Template to the \"MASTER\" cell (the blue tabbed cell). This is the design you'll create alternate versions of.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Add the layers, content, or keywords in the appropriately labeled red-tabbed cells.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Add the \"Override\" information in those red tabs. When you \"Sync\" the sheet, FigSheets will look for the layer names or keywords to create new versions of your Master.</p><p><br></p><p>5. Hit \"Sync!\" Alternate versions should appear like magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Tip: If you want to generate Components, just make your Master Template a Component or Instance. The components will inherit the name of the Master Template and append the text in the purple \"RESULT\" tab (which you can rename).</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/832413678664668511","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/832413678664668511/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/832413678664668511/thumbnail"}
