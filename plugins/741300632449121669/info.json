Not a problem. Select any layers you want to snap back to the pixel grid, and presto, their position and size are rounded back to nice round numbers.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Select layers you'd like to apply Pixel Perfect to.\n2. Pixel Perfect will run on all children of any selected frame or group, so you can simply select the top level frames.\n3. Run the Plugin\n4. Pixel Perfect will modify the position of size of each layer so its x/y position and width and height are on full pixels: 200 instead of 200.45\n5. By default Pixel Perfect won't affect shape anchor points, but you can turn that feature on and Pixel Perfect will also move the anchor points of any shape path selected.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/741300632449121669","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/741300632449121669/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/741300632449121669/thumbnail"}
