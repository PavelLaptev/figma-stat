Our design team has been slowly pulling our color libraries into Figma, and early on in the process, we realized this was a long and tedious task. Because the color themes for the products we work on can be quite extensive, manually creating color styles and a visual color guide takes a lot of time. We decided that Microsoft's Hackathon 2019 would be an excellent opportunity to team up and try and fix this problem. Over the course of three days, we built Kaleidocode to address the gap in our workflow and improve the design process not only for our team but anyone else designing for VS Code.</p><p><br></p><p>Kaleidocode's creators are Kaitlin Wilkinson, Miguel Solorio, and Pine Wu.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/736060893363678891","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/736060893363678891/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/736060893363678891/thumbnail"}
