Let’s look at some ways to achieve accurate results:</p><ul><li>Ensure that the frames have auto layout. It helps us to parse your Design better and also good for scaling designs in long term.</li><li>Mark the image/icon layers for export in the desirable format. We will import the asset in the selected format for you.</li><li>Avoid the use of Fixed Height/Width constraints as much as possible. Nearly same results can be achieved using ‘Fill container’/’Hug contents’ constraint.</li></ul>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1065278044402066626","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1065278044402066626/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1065278044402066626/thumbnail"}
