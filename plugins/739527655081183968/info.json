Jot down todos, ideas, research, meeting notes, and other bits of information relevant to your design work.\n\nNotes are automatically saved with your documents and accessible wherever you use Figma. And like your Figma documents, your Notepad notes too are accessible by other editors. So you can use Notepad as a shared space for documenting your project with your team.\n\n(Please keep in mind that changes made by other editors do not appear live while you have Notepad open. You will need to reopen Notepad to see their changes.)","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739527655081183968","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739527655081183968/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739527655081183968/thumbnail"}
