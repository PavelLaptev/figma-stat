And almost every design comes with Figma. And it is really boring to add new variables to Scss.(you know, copy color, add new variable and stuff like this...) And that's why i've made it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How to use:</strong></p><ul><li>Create local styles for your project</li><li>Open extension</li><li>Press CSS or SCSS button</li><li>And copy your colors</li></ul><p>That's all!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/893890249436355073","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/893890249436355073/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/893890249436355073/thumbnail"}
