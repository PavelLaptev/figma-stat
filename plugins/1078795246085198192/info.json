This is built in so that in future the plugin can support intelligently completing half-built variant sets, but it seems like it would be very prone to edge cases so I'm not sure if I'll ever support it. For now, use the plugin on either sole components or variant sets without checked states defined.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1078795246085198192","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1078795246085198192/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1078795246085198192/thumbnail"}
