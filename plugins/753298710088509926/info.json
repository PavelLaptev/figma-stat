Select 2+ layers. Also if you select only one group or frame plugin will work the same way as you selected all its children, so you don't have to do it manually (there still have to be 2 or more children though)\n\n2. Choose the number of columns and gaps between rows and columns. The gap amount would be also saved for the next use.\n\n3. Click \"Change\" or hit Enter. Done!\n\nPro tips:\n• A plugin is aware of initial layer positions (top to bottom, left to right), so if you need to squeeze in one more block and push the rest of them down just place its top-left corner in right place and rerun the plugin. \n\n• It's especially easy to place everything in one row, as the plugin will suggest a total amount of selected layers as the number of columns. Just Call the plugin and hit Enter.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/753298710088509926","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/753298710088509926/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/753298710088509926/thumbnail"}
