This creates a centralized, platform-agnostic source of truth, where your development team can access all your designs and tokens and download pre-generated code snippets. All of the design updates can be compared to the previous versions with a handy visual difference tool, showing you all the changes, even the smallest ones. Comments, version history, and prototype player are all built in to help your dev team understand the app flow. Jira, Azure Boards, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Xcode, and Android Studio integrations together with an optional on-premises set up are also available for a seamless workflow.</p><p><br></p><p>Demo video: <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/sympli/figma-tutorial\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://vimeo.com/sympli/figma-tutorial</a></p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/769264592946461883","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/769264592946461883/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/769264592946461883/thumbnail"}
