Plugin remembers last value for the next time.\n\nHow to use:\n1. Select one layer that you want to copy. Works with Components, Frames and other types of layers.\n2. Call the plugin. The plugin has 4 different commands for cloning in all 4 directions.\n3. Name your copies. Use tab for creating another copy, so you can name all of them in one approach to the keyboard.\n4. (Optional) Hit Shift+Tab to focus on Shift input, then type the desired distance between the copies. The plugin will remember that value next time.\n4. Hit Enter to create your copies.\n\nAlso, visit this thread for video demo: https://twitter.com/aswellasyouare/status/1169334638805958658","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/746805909751572002","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/746805909751572002/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/746805909751572002/thumbnail"}
