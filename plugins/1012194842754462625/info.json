It’s simple and easy to use:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Select any object(s) and add them to your tour.</p><p>2. Tap the arrows to navigate your FigJam board.</p><p>3. Tap the X button to remove a view or the trash can to start from scratch.</p><p><br></p><p>With Tour Guide, you can screen share a FigJam board as if it were a slide deck, and quickly navigate to the highlights you’ve selected. No more need to scroll and hunt.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Tour Guide is built with a little intelligence in the background. If you move objects, Tour Guide will continue to follow them around. If you delete objects, Tour Guide will remove them from the tour automatically.</p><p><br></p><p>I built this plugin so I could present FigJam boards easily, and welcome your feedback to make it even better for the future.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1012194842754462625","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1012194842754462625/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1012194842754462625/thumbnail"}
