If you know the font size range for each of the optical size variations, let me know.</p><p><br></p><h2>Context</h2><p>When texts with SF fonts are rendered on iOS, their variant and tracking (letter spacing) are adjusted based on their point size and the user's accessibility settings. In Figma, the tracking must be manually applied to get a more accurate representation. Hence, Fix San Francisco is here to automate this process for you ♥</p><p><br></p><p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://github.com/kylehickinson/Sketch-SF-UI-Font-Fixer\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sketch-SF-UI-Font-Fixer</a>.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742063658553085504","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742063658553085504/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/742063658553085504/thumbnail"}
