This way when you use SPELLL on a new device those words will not be spell checked again.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/754026612866636376","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/754026612866636376/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/754026612866636376/thumbnail"}
