The algorithm is fast but can sometimes lead to unusual results, such as with low-colour images, images of vector graphics, and so on. The extracted colours may not exactly match the hex codes in the image.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731841207668879837","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731841207668879837/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731841207668879837/thumbnail"}
