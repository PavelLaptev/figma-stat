Very handy for randomizing graphs, lists, confetti pieces, and more. It's pretty powerful and I'm sure you'll find fun stuff to use it for!</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Properties you can randomize:</strong></h1><p><br></p><ul><li>Text</li><li>Width</li><li>Height</li><li>X</li><li>Y</li><li>Opacity</li><li>Rotation</li><li>Fill Color</li><li>Fill Opacity</li><li>Stroke Color</li><li>Stroke Opacity</li><li>Stroke Weight</li><li>Layer Blur</li><li>Arc Starting Angle</li><li>Arc Ending Angle</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Missing one? Just ask me and I can try to add support for it.</p><p><br></p><h1>How to use:</h1><p><br></p><p>Make a selection of elements (components, frames, shapes, etc.) Select whichever properties you'd like to randomize, tweak the config to your liking, and click the button at the bottom.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Mash the Return key to keep re-generating new randomizations within the constraints you set. Not happy with your confetti or bar graph? Just. Keep. Randomizing!</p><p><br></p><p>You've got three methods of randomization to choose from, per property:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Range</strong> for randomizing bars in a graph, for example, allowing you to constrain height between a min and max value.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>List</strong> for making confetti, for example, by letting you randomize the fillColor of your selected elements, but keeping them within your chosen palette.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Calc</strong> does multiplication or addition rather than just picking numbers out of the air. Consider slowly growing bubbles by multiplying their width and height by 1.1â€“1.5x. Just keep randomizing and they'll keep growing slightly until you're happy with the results.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>For each type, you have the option to apply the randomized values in a sorted order. Consider making a bar graph, but you want to show profits getting bigger and bigger. Generate as many as you like until you're happy, in mere seconds!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you try to randomize a property that's unsupported by the elements in your selection (eg: \"strokeColor\" on elements without a stroke), that property will simply be skipped; supported properties will still be randomized.</p><p><br></p><p>Feedback would be very much appreciated.
