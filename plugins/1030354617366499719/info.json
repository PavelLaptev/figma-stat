Developing such projects can be very tedious, and inconsistencies in design and development can negatively affect the overall design view after development.</p><p><br></p><p>Figma2Android plugin reduces the number of measurements of sizes, indents and positions of nodes, layer design operations and saves time / energy, even if the developer and designer are the same person.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Usage</strong></h2><p>Just open the plugin window in Figma, select a node to get the Jetpack Compose code to display it!</p><p><br></p><p>You can convert entire design pages, but Jetpack Compose has a limitation on the content of one function, and to make the code easier to reuse, we recommend converting in smaller blocks, just like when you develop an application in the usual way. This method will not only speed up the development of the entire application, but also immediately create a base of reusable blocks in the code.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1030354617366499719","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1030354617366499719/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1030354617366499719/thumbnail"}
