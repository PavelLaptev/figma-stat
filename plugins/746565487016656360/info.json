It's useful for when you need to generate columns and/or rows in a specific container without having to calculate the size manually. \n\n• Works with normal shapes, text layers, groups and frames\n• Add gutter in between those instances.\n• Add margin at the front and back.\n• Existing styles from the original shape (color, background image, etc) is preserved in all instances.\n\nIdeas & improvement:\n[✓] Remember previously entered option values\n[✓] No need to re-open plugin if you forgot to make a selection\n[   ] Turn those boring textfields into nicer numeric steppers\n[   ] Improve UI with icon / visual representation of each option\n[   ] ...?\n\nTweet at @gaddafirusli if you have other suggestions and ideas.\n\nSee usage examples & updates in my Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/gaddafirusli/status/1164894899453382656\n\n-------------------------------\nThis plugin is 100% inspired by kupe517's Sketch plugin of the same name: https://github.com/kupe517/sketch-split-shape","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/746565487016656360","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/746565487016656360/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/746565487016656360/thumbnail"}
