I became tired of manually applying export settings across assets and projects. So this was born March 21st, locked up in my apartment.\n\n‚ö°Ô∏è Lazy Export allows the user to apply default export settings to selected objects in Figma.\n\nüß† How does it work?\nThere are two ways to trigger your export settings to be applied. The first is a window giving you UI access to run the plugin commands. (Set Platform, Apply Settings, Clear Settings)\nThe second is via the plugin menu; this makes the actions searchable in Figma with the `‚åò+/` command.\n\nüîß  Currently supported:\n‚Ä¢ IOS \n‚Ä¢ IOS Adv.\n‚Ä¢ Android\n‚Ä¢ Android Adv.\n‚Ä¢ Web\n\nüì¶ Export Options\n\n‚ú® Export Settings\nWith Lazy export, you have two mobile options on how you can apply export settings.\n\n‚Ä¢ Default Export\n‚Ä¢ Advanced Export\n\nWith the default export, this follows the trends for exporting assets for mobile at the different screen densities. Advanced is still being worked on for a smooth workflow.\n\n‚ÑπÔ∏è The end goal for Advanced Export Options, would be for a developer to hit apply, and Figma exports a folder of assets the developer can drop into Android Studio or Xcode.\n\nAndroid Suffix\n`drawable-mdpi`\n\nIOS Suffix\n`/default-asset@1x`\n\nAndroid Advance Suffix\n`/drawable-mdpi/default-asset`\n\nIOS Advance Suffix\n`/default-asset.imageset/default-asset@1x`\n\n‚úçÔ∏è Custom Asset Naming\n\nRight now, if you do not apply a custom name to each asset, a default one will be used. \n    üìÜ I have plans on the roadmap to adjust this.\n\nDefault Name String = `default-asset`\n\nüêõ Have a feature request or bug?
