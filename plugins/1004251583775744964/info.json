However,<strong> Lasca enables front-end automation in a completely developer-friendly way</strong> through the following approaches.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Convert Figma designs including responsiveness to HTML &amp; CSS perfectly</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Lasca converts not only visual elements but also responsive web design using Figma’s constraints and auto layout precisely.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Configure UI logics &amp; interaction with APIs</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Lasca allows you to configure UI logics (condition, loop, variable, event) and interaction with API. They are essential to web applications.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. With combination with your own coding, there is nothing you can’t build</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Converted code will be automatically inserted into your frontend code in the place of lasca tag ( &lt;lasca&gt;&lt;/lasca&gt; ) through your build process with webpack.</p><p><br></p><p>Lasca does not control entire our vue.js project. It is incrementally adoptable. You can choose to automate the front-end using the lasca tag or code it yourself in various ways.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Get started</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You can test Lasca quickly using Get started guide <a href=\"https://doc.lasca.app/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You may find certain features do not export correctly.
