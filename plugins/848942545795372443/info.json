You can read the documentation in the link below around why density independent pixels are used to support multiple devices. \n\nhttps://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities\n\nHow to Use \n\n1. Select the frame containing the asset you'd like to export\n2. Press `command + /` or search for `Android Pixel Density Export Settings` in the Plugins menu\n3. Run the plugin\n4. Export settings should be prefilled \n\nAll credit goes to @brian (Brian Lovin) whose plugin (iOS Export Settings) gave me the initial idea and also allowed me to fork his repo on GitHub and tweak a few values to publish this plugin.\n\nFeel free to ping me on Twitter @justinmfarrugia if you have any questions or ideas around how I can extend this plugin.","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/848942545795372443","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/848942545795372443/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/848942545795372443/thumbnail"}
