This is handy if your master components are on another page!\n\nHow it works\n1. Select an instance of a local component \n\n2. Run 'Edit in place' (If you have selected a component from a library, the plugin will tell you).\n\n3. The plugin will hide your instance and move your master in the context of your design so that you can edit it.\n\n4.
