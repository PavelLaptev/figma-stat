Generate CSS for all elements in a frame, page, selection or for all elements in the whole document.\n2. Hide CSS properties you don't want to copy to your project's CSS code.\n3. Spot styling errors by viewing only unique values for specific CSS properties.\n4. Filter CSS by layer type to, for example, show only the CSS for text layers in a selected frame.\n\nThis is a plugin I imagined being useful while working with Figma as a web developer. Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any feedback!","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/811977401825396882","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/811977401825396882/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/811977401825396882/thumbnail"}
