I'm working to fix this. I encountered this on an imported file once.</li><li>Paste in and Paste in Place behave unexpected sometimes. Working to fix it.</li><li>There is an issue with rescale to fit/fill to parent when used on instances. I need to investigate this further. Can't say if is an API bug or not.</li></ul><h1><br></h1><h1><strong>Notes</strong></h1><ol><li>If you encounter any weird behaviour, remember that anything can be Undo. Also, please report the behaviour and I'll do my best to fix it.</li><li>Planning to remove the copy/paste limitations in the next updates.</li><li>If you're using the Search menu, and you want to resize or align, I recommend to search directly for \"Horizontally\", \"Left\", \"Center\" to get fewer results.</li><li>Draw Lines will place the lines on Canvas as I couldn't decide where is the most natural place to have these, especially when drawing from or in an instance as source or as target. I usually use Paste in Place to move these lines.</li><li>To select the first or the last layer from a group, you can select one layer from the group, press <code>Shift + Enter</code>, then <code>Enter</code>, then use Select Next/Previous Siblings in the plugin.</li></ol><p><br></p><h1>ðŸ“£ Feedback needed</h1><p>I really appreciate any feedback.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to know what you're using the most and what features you're looking for to see implemented.</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/950514102619019349","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/950514102619019349/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/950514102619019349/thumbnail"}
