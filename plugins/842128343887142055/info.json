If items are aligned, even if AutoLayout is off, it will internally consider them as an AutoLayout. Your project is always safe, as the plugin doesn't modify anything.</p><p><br></p><p>This project is also Open Source, well tested (over 98% in coverage), and expandable. Jetpack Compose is planned for soon, and other platforms are also welcome.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel free to say hi on Twitter or Reddit (@bernaferrari) and please tell me what you love, your ideas, suggestions, or show me what you have made with it!</p>","url":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/842128343887142055","iconUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/842128343887142055/icon","thumbnailUrl":"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/842128343887142055/thumbnail"}
