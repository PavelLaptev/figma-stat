To create animated art, simply create a regular Figma Group or Frame, whose name starts with “⏱”. When the widget character overlaps this art, it will cycle visibility on its child nodes. The child nodes are the animation frames.</li><li>🏠 <strong>Home</strong> - when within this node, widget will show a property menu that lets you change characters.
